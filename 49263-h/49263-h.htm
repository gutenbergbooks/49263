</div>

<p><span class="sc">Respectable</span> is a word that has been wrested
from its true meaning of worthy of respect, and
applied to the most sordid characteristics and
conditions of human life. Respectability, like
vulgarity and prudery, is an Anglo-Saxon attribute
appertinent chiefly to the huge middle-class
part of society. It is not the fetish of "the
upper ten thousand," nor do the majority of the
working class bow down before it. Respectability
stands for gentility, and the genteel folk
are not often of the orders aristocratic and proletarian,
but of the bourgeoisie. To call a decent,
intelligent man respectable is to dub him genteel,
and to label him so implies that he has
reached about the lowest level of mental
degradation. Would it not be an act of sheer
defamation of character to describe Ben Jonson,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Shakspere, Dryden, Fielding, and Burns as
"respectable men?" No great man has ever
been, or ever can be, of the respectabilities, for
the simple reason that the great are not
ordinary, and the ordinary alone are respectable.
Have you ever read or heard of a truly noble man
or woman who was also respectable? Nobility
of character and a reputation for respectability,
the two things are utterly incompatible! Supposing
it possible for an original mind to pursue
the preposterous chimera of respectability, where
would such a mind find itself ultimately? Prone
and lazy on "the unclean straw of intellectual
habits," an impotent among impotents, or a
sheep among sheep.</p>

<p>The respectable man is a slave to convention,
and therefore a stick-i'-the-mire. He is fearful
of being deemed a crank, so fearful that he succeeds
in becoming a nonentity. Now some men
are born respectable; they could never be anything
else. But that is no reason why they
should exert the tyranny of their personal preferences
over the minorities of their fellow-men.
Defiance of Respectability is the beginning and
the end of social progress; you cannot be at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
once highly respectable and progressive. Respectability
is one of those dull and sordid sins
that are entirely without charm.</p>

<p>All good, regular conduct was once bad and
irregular. But originality and irregularity are
abhorred of the respectable mass. "He who lets
the world, or his portion of it, choose his plan of
life for him," says J. S. Mill, "has no need of
any other faculty than the ape-like one of imitation."
It is by the exercise of this simious
instinct that "genteel" people order their lives
down to the minutest detail. They scout eccentricity
and individuality of speculation and judgment;
they live in streets of houses all built
alike; they imitate each others' mode of dress,
think each others' thoughts, and say "It is better
to be dead than out of the fashion!"</p>

<p>Originality! is there anything greater under
the sun? "Yes," say the Respectables, "it is
better to be a sheep amongst sheep than to gain
a name for eccentricity." This is why our
national, moral, intellectual, and artistic advance
is so slow: men and women infected by the
craze for respectability act as dead weights on
the arms of pioneers. Grundy, Bowdler, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Podsnap are the three gods of the shoddy
respectabilities.</p>

<p>Respectability! who has it not cursed and perverted
at some time in his life? There is perhaps
no better instance of the moral blight that
respectability has upon the middle-class mind
than the treatment of Mr. Bradlaugh, not only
at the hands of rabid sectarians, but by timorous
and respectable rationalists and utter indifferentists.</p>

<p>It may be taken as an axiom that if you want
to blast a man's reputation as a tolerable specimen
of the human race, you have merely to class
him as respectable. The very word is damnatory
and detestable. At best it always leaves
a bad flavour of middle-class hashes in the
mouth, and wafts to the nostrils the reek of
stuffy parlours with horsehair couches, dried
grass, and wax flowers. "A most respectable
man." We all know him&mdash;a sort of factory-made
cheap line in humanity, with a few prim,
precise, little superstitions, no reasoned morals,
and no intellectual or æsthetic needs. He is a
big man of a petty sect, and on Sunday he troops
a stout, silk-dressed wife and seven or eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
children to hear Boanerges hold forth at the tin
Bethel at the end of the street. This is one
type, perhaps the commonest. Another sort is
not particularly pietistic, but "eminently respectable."
He lives at Brixton or Clapham in
a continuous struggle to keep up a "decent"
appearance among the neighbours. His wife
"takes in paying guests," and his daughters
spend most of their time in blocking the pavement
in front of drapers' shops. Mamma and
the girls are gangrened with respectability and
snobbishness, but were it not for the inherited
virus they might have been decent and wholesome
women. Their minds are blank to all the
wider interests of life; they are simply
mechanical dolls. Says a woman concerning
these types: "I have known miners, railway
men, iron and cotton and wool workers, many
who have denied themselves physical necessities
to buy and read a book, attend lectures, or a concert.
I never knew a middle-class woman guilty
of such a glaring want of common-sense."</p>

<p>To live respectably, as the world deems
respectability, is to live a lie. No man or
woman with a part to play in life can play it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
well if they are constantly exercised as to what
people will think&mdash;people, in this instance,
standing for Respectability. Can any wholesome
influence come out of the frowsy atmosphere
of a villa inhabited by Veneerings? As
well expect to find lilies within the fences of the
alkali works. The fact is that what Respectability
thinks is never of the slightest importance
to a man of real moral stamina and vigour
of intellect. He has learnt with Schopenhauer
that reputation is of little avail in the making
of happiness. "What we are in and for ourselves,"
says that philosopher, "is of sole
moment; and if we have had an opportunity of
seeing how the greatest of men will meet with
nothing but slight from half-a-dozen blockheads,
we shall understand that to lay great
value upon what other people say is to pay them
too much honour."</p>

<p>A woman who was horribly crushed in the
Crewe railway accident begged the surgeon with
her dying breath to set her bonnet straight. It
was not death that she feared, but the opinion of
that grimmer monster Respectability; a striking
instance this of the firm hold that the
instinct has upon feeble minds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, to be appraised as a thoroughly respectable
man among Philistines, you must either
possess scanty ideas, or you must perpetually
dissemble your opinions. Dr. Stockman, in
Ibsen's "An Enemy of Society," is ostracised
by respectable society because he refuses to be
an unmitigated liar. A finer satire on Respectability
has never been written. Stockman discovers
that the water supply of the town is polluted,
and he tells the truth about it. The
respectable authorities, the tag-rag of the bourgeoisie,
and the toady editor of the local journal&mdash;who
is at heart a Freethinker&mdash;hoot him down
in compliance with the "respectable" methods
of toleration usually accorded to reformers. At
a public meeting the Doctor says:</p>

<p class="bq">"I am going to make a great revelation to you, fellow-citizens!
I am going to disclose that to you which is
of infinitely more moment than the unimportant fact
that our waterworks are poisonous, and that our hygienic
baths are built upon a soil teeming with pestilence....
I have said I should speak of the great discovery I have
made within the last few days&mdash;the discovery that all
our spiritual sources of life are poisoned, and that our
whole bourgeois society rests upon a soil teeming with
the pestilence of lies. For I am going to revolt against
the lie that truth resides in the majority."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon reading a Philistine opinion of himself,
Diderot laughed, and said: "I must be an eccentric
sort of fellow: but is it such a great fault
to have preserved amid all the friction of society
some vestiges of the angularity of nature?"</p>

<p>No thralls to Respectability can ever be
natural men and women. The respectability of
the middle-class is largely a growth of the Calvinistic
theory of submission and poorness of
spirit; the effort of the Respectables is towards
docile conformity to the custom of their narrow
community, "until," as Mill says, "by dint of
not following their own nature, they have no
nature to follow: their human capacities are
withered and starved: they become incapable
of any strong wishes or native pleasures, and
are generally without either opinions or feelings
of home growth or properly their own." No
fanatical fakir ever endured the torments that
some English folk inflict upon themselves before
the Mumbo Jumbo of respectability. Dwarfed
social endeavour, suppressed healthy desires,
degraded faculties&mdash;these are the sacrifices in the
name of conventionality. Daily, men and women
do a score of things that they know to be hurtful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and insane, because they fear to be accounted
"peculiar," and "not quite respectable;" and
so it comes about that "the keeping up of
appearances," as it is called, the incessant striving
to be popular at all costs, engenders endless
hypocrisies and falsehoods, and makes knaves
and cowards.</p>

<p>Not content with warping our national character
by slavish veneration of this abstraction, we
have corrupted decent barbarians by inoculating
them with our miserable disease of Respectability.
We have clothed the innocent nude,
and taught them shame, and in making them
respectable we have annihilated their pristine
morality, and substituted Western cant and
indecency. Fortunately, however, the savage is
too wholesome an animal to become respectable
without protest, and in most instances, we have
failed to convince him of the benefits of insanitary
clothing as badges of respectability and
tokens of civilisation. Quoting from Dalton,
Reclus, in his "Primitive Folk," says of the
Kolarian women:&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq">"These savage women win hearts by their frank and
open manners and naïve gaiety. Mixing freely from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
earliest childhood with the other sex, they have none of
the prudery of Hindoos and Mussulmans, who have been
brought up in strict seclusion; a prudery which at
moments gives place to unclean talk, and is full of suggested
obscenities. On the other hand, the modest grace
of young Hos or Moonah maidens and the little girls of
the Larkas is a subject of praise. Patience! Civilisation
will soon cure them of this barbarism, will correct their
ignorance."</p>

<p>It is a wretched reflection that these delightful
women will one day be as respectable as the
female natives of Stoke Newington.</p>

<p>A lady novelist writes that every English
woman is a savage at heart. Does she not pay
her sisters too high a compliment? The enforced
clothing of the Curumbas women of Malabar, at
the instigation of the "respectable English
ladies" at Calcutta, is one of the pitiful examples
of the indecency of thought born of our ideas
of respectability. These damsels of the Curumbas
tribe wore aprons of leaves suspended from a
bead waistband. Such garb was not only
suited to the climate, but it was charming as well
as healthy. The Calcutta British Matrons
thought such wear abominable. How could
these women be respectable in such scanty
drapery? Accordingly, by direction of Bumble,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
four corporals and two sergeants of infantry were
told off with a company to drag the leaf aprons
from the front and behind, and to put the women
into petticoats. The greenery was then burned
in a bonfire. What a glorious triumph of Respectability!
How thoroughly British matronly
and indelicate in conception was this compulsory
clothing of innocent modest women by Tommy
Atkins and his "pals." Is there the least need
to dwell upon the contrast of decency that these
Curumbas women present to the "respectable
English ladies" of Calcutta?</p>

<p>Our insular arrogance is the twin sister of
respectability. When we are not taking pride
in the personal possession of a pot-hat and a
frock coat, we go about bragging of national
respectability and superiority. "Every miserable
fool who has nothing at all of which he can
be proud," says Schopenhauer, "adopts as a last
resource pride in the nation to which he belongs;
he is ready and glad to defend all its faults and
follies tooth and nail, thus reimbursing himself
for his inferiority. For example, if you speak
of the stupid and degrading bigotry of the
English nation with the contempt it deserves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
you will hardly find one Englishman in fifty to
agree with you; but if there should be one, he
will generally happen to be an intelligent
man!"</p>

<p>Nothing can destroy Respectability but a
gradual extirpation of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>. I say
gradual advisedly, and in a double sense; first,
because we have many respectable relatives and
friends whom we would be grieved to asphyxiate;
and, second, because gradual processes in
social evolution have more permanent resultants
than cataclysms. Diderot, with wonderful prescience,
asserted that a scientific anarchism is
the extreme goal of social progress. This was in
1776. In 1897 a thousand sociologists recognise
this fact, this "<i>diablement idéal</i>," as Diderot
termed it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="ac larger">THE PATHOLOGY OF THE DISEASE.</p>

<div class="bq">"The evil is not merely a stagnation of blood, but a stagnation of spirit.
Many, no doubt, are well disposed, but sluggish by constitution and by habit,
or they cannot conceive of a man who is actuated by higher motives than
they are."</div>

<div class="ar">
<span class="sc">Thoreau.</span>
</div>


<p>I had written my first chapter when I met a
friend possessed of the qualities of moral and
intellectual seriousness, which, when conjoined
with a sense of humour, are proper elements for
the making of a fine man. This estimable
Mentor had read my midnight lucubration with
a sad heart. He told me, with appropriate
gravity, that his standpoint was the ethical-cum-philosophic.
Judged from that imposing
standard, my "screed" depressed him by reason
of its "cynicism."</p>

<p>"I wish," said he, "that you had dealt less
ruthlessly with the Philistine. Is he not a man
and a brother?"</p>

<p>Whereupon he proceeded to administer reproof
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
with Demosthenic eloquence, concluding with
the altruistic admission, "Though I have endured
much from the Philistine, I still love
him."</p>

<p>Well, the Respectables are a large body, very
much in the majority so far as my researches
have informed me; and, if the right and the
truth are on their side, they will not be worsted
in a fair encounter. I am still impertinently
chuckling at that charge of cynicism and ruthlessness.
I love not Diogenes nor Torquemada.
By all means let us be just and fear not in this
anatomy of the Respectable Person. Have I
not said that "were it not for the inherited
virus," the veneering girls "might have been
decent and wholesome women?" Did I not
indicate a method of prophylaxis, a scientific,
humane, and gradual extinction of the taint?
Vulgarity, snobbery, prudery and obscenity are
common specific contagious affections, manifesting
a dangerous tendency to increase. I regard
these diseases, with their concomitants and
sequelæ as momentous social evils, and it is
entirely on humanitarian principles that I emphatically
refuse to sprinkle rose-water over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
victims of the contagion, and to leave the disorders
to take their lingering and miserable
course. These ailments are, without question,
hereditary, and the microbes have a strong and
deadly hold upon the host. I pity the vulgarian,
the snob, and the prude; I commiserate them
with the same sympathy that I extend to the
leper, the blind, and the insane. Every physician
must perforce at times be cruel to be kind; and
I do not intend to exercise injudicious gentleness
in treating these forms of mental disease.</p>

<p>It is well known that firmness, amounting
occasionally to severity, is most essential in dealing
with certain neuroses. Therefore, from that
ethical basis upon which my honourable Mentor
takes his stand, I shall discuss these social disorders
in plain vigorous terms, recognising that
the Respectable is not to be cured and his offspring
preserved from the inherited sting by
sentimental demonstrations of fraternal affection
and pats on the back. Such methods as that
have utterly failed. No, we must endeavour to
convince the sufferer from chronic respectability
that he is an anti-social being, a moral and
mental paralytic, a prey to the hallucinations and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
dreads of his class, showing by this very habit
of imitation that serious lesions have arisen
within his brain.</p>

<p>As in many diseases, the congenital cases of
Respectability are the most stubborn, and the
prognosis cannot often be technically described
as "good." It is a serious and important fact
to be carefully noted by the Respectable, that
many incurable imbeciles are the descendants of
steady, stolid, and apparently well-conducted
ancestors of the trading order, the folk who live
in a petty round of narrow interests, without the
inclination to form their minds, and without any
cultivation of the æsthetic and poetic sides of
their natures. If you add to this a dour religiosity
of the ultra-puritanic type, you have an
excellent nidus of insanity. In every asylum
you may find the heirs of such unfortunate prenatal
influences. They are the victims of certain
forms of Respectability, the result of "the ape-like
faculty of imitation" in their forbears.</p>

<p>What were the peculiarities of these ancestors
whose idiosyncracies have degenerated into
actual brain disease? <i>They tried to be conventional.</i>
It was of no matter to them what Bacon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
or Diderot or Herbert Spencer said about the
conduct of life. Their ethical guides were the
lesser lights of the sectaries, the pastors and
deacons of Zoar and Bethesda, teachers often,
akin in intelligence to Mr. Ruskin's "little
squeaking idiot," telling "an audience of seventeen
old women and three louts that they were
the only children of God in Turin." All their
"culture" came from such inspired sources.
They were afraid of God, but, as a minor poet
says, more afraid of Mrs Grundy. Mrs. Brown,
Mrs. Smith, and Mrs. Robinson were their models;
the Brownian view of life was good enough for
them. Was not Mr. Brown very respectable?
Did not Mrs. Smith set the example in <i>ton</i>, in
Little Muddleton Road? Was not Mrs. Robinson
distantly related to a branch of the aristocracy?
They lived like human sheep. If one
of the flock jumped automatically, the others
began to jump; and one moral or social <i>baa</i> set
all the rest bleating in the same respectable
mechanical strain. Rarely a boy or a girl in the
community began to develop healthy independence
of judgment, or a taste for one of the
arts or sciences. If the youthful rebel had tough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
grit in him he pursued his own course against
tremendous obstacles, and amid taunts of eccentricity
and disrespectability, until he freed himself
from the miserable petty tyranny of the
Brownian and Smithian codes. But if the boy
or the girl of originality was timid and submissive,
Respectability triumphed, and society lost a
useful member. It is impossible to estimate the
immense amount of moral, intellectual, and
artistic capacity that has been impaired, perverted,
and stamped out of existence in the bud
by the slavish worshippers at the altar of the
Goddess Grundy.</p>

<p>I do not deny that a strong mind may emerge
comparatively unscathed from the blighting environment
of Little Muddleton Road; but a man
or woman with inherited Respectability in his or
her fibres, starts life's race handicapped, and it
may need years before the poison can be eradicated
from the moral system. In most cases the
true congenital Respectable is a hopeless subject
for experimentation. The task of reforming
him needs far more patience and tact than most
reformers possess; and even if the patient shows
improvement, a transference into the infected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
areas is certain to result in a recrudescence of the
disorder. Remember the true Congenital Respectable
inherits a very vigorous and malignant
taint; that his system is surcharged with
humours that resist the most patient treatment.
Are we, then, to despair of a cure? The answer
must be, "No, not if all the available
hygienic remedies are employed while the
Respectable is young." I could not hope
to heal the mind of a patient of forty,
for instance, and especially a female
patient of that age. In women there are
characteristic symptoms of a nature so peculiar
that we must differentiate them in our pathology
from the specific manifestations of the affection
in men.</p>

<p>Obviously, the greatest impediment to recovery
lies in the fact that, in nine instances out of ten, the
subject has no desire to be cured. Respectability
presents the phenomenon of most neurotic diseases:
the patient does not understand that he
is ill. If you tell a maniac that he is not the
Emperor of Russia, but an inmate of Bedlam, he
will think you are the madman, and that he is
the sane man. In the same way, a person
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
attacked by an insidious wasting malady
imagines he is in robust health, because, when he
has eaten a full meal he feels ready to eat
another. He thumps himself on the chest, and
says, "Sound as a bell! Look at my appetite!"
Like these deluded folk, the Respectable believes
firmly that his derangement is a normal healthy
state. All his friends are Respectable; he is
Respectable also, thank heaven!</p>

<p>While the Respectable remains in this grateful
frame nothing can be done for him. You
must convince him that Respectability is a
species of mania, and until you have done this,
there is palpably no hope of curing him. Ridicule,
contempt, satire&mdash;these are the instruments
that you must employ. Scarify him mentally, if
you can, with Titanic laughter at his wretched
hallucination. Kick his preposterous idol till
the sawdust flies out of it; deride it, mutilate it,
tear off its flimsy tinsel. You must be prepared
for a tussle with the Respectable. He will fight
long and savagely for his fetish, for it is the god
of his fathers, and he was taught to revere it
when he left the cradle. He is fighting for all
that he conceives to be most dear and sacred to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
him, and he looks upon you as an impious iconoclast
and a fanatic. To a Respectable, all are
mad who seek to destroy illusions, to show the
inside of things, and to disencumber the social
ground of the tares and thistles that make such
a brave show. He loves his world of seems and
shams and hypocrisies.</p>

<p>Our hope is in the young, in the rising generation,
ere they are hopelessly crushed and disfigured
beyond all recognition beneath the wheels
of Respectability's triumphal one-horse
brougham; before their callow brains are
dwarfed and warped in Dame Grundy's seminary
and in Dr. Birch's select school for the sons of
wholesale tea merchants; before the miasma of
Villadom has poisoned their morals and befogged
their mental vision. Education must be widened
and democratized. The principle that "a mon's
a mon for a' that" must be inculcated, and true
worth of character will then be dissociated in the
mind from that vile, tawdry, make-belief virtue
called Respectability.</p>

<p>"Is she a Lady or a Person?" asked a British
Matron when I spoke of a certain young woman.
The question is well calculated to set one pondering
on those nice distinctions of class, and sub-distinctions
within the classes, characteristic of
most semi-civilised and so-called highly civilised
nations of the world. Unquestionably, my interrogator
was a "lady" in the popular sense of the
title. She lived in a large house, received visits
from the rector and the curate, gave parties attended
by well-to-do tradesfolk and one or two
professional men, with their wives and families,
and refrained from committing the misdemeanour
of carrying parcels in the street. Undoubtedly
she was considered a lady by most
members of her own order. But was she a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
lady? I confess I do not know what you in particular
mean by a lady. I must know you tolerably
intimately before I can even hazard a surmise.
This dame was the daughter of a tradesman,
and she earned her own livelihood. That
is quite enough to stamp her as a mere person in
the judgment of an immense class.</p>

<p>For many years I have been trying to understand
the jargon of Respectability, and I have
failed. I cannot get three people in one room
to entirely agree as to the constituents of a lady
or a gentleman. One will tell me that the claim
to the distinction depends upon birth; another
denies this, and says it is simply a matter of
good manners; but a third, in spite of my protest
that the manners of my housemaid betoken
a <i>gentle</i>-woman, affirms that her social status
debars a domestic servant from the label <i>lady</i>,
though she may be a very well-behaved young
woman. If you think it is easy to obtain a precise
definition of lady and gentleman, I suggest
that you interrogate your near acquaintances,
and make notes of the answers. Perchance your
luck is better than mine.</p>

<p>No, I do not to this day know exactly what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
people mean by calling this man <i>gentleman</i> and
that man plain <i>man</i>. I have heard that there
was a time when only those men who plundered
the poor, swore "gad-zooks" and very much
worse than that, got drunk nearly every night,
and debauched a great number of maids were the
only respectable gentlemen in the land, all the
rest, who were not "up to" this "form" in usual
practice being churls, and knaves, and clowns.
It is a matter of history that these crapulous
bandits were the only gentlemen of their day.</p>

<p>But take the phrase in its most modern sense.
A. is a patrician, and therefore pre-eminently a
gentleman in the esteem of tens of thousands.
He uses the foulest back-slum expressions in the
hunting-field, "pals" with harlots, gamblers of
shady notoriety, and ruffianly hybrid sportsmen
of the turf and ring, drinks to excess, and, after
a career of low vice and mean trickery, he pays
his creditors&mdash;many of them struggling tradesmen&mdash;sixpence
in the pound, or less than that.
<i>You</i> say he is no gentleman. Quite so; but he
is received in that polite company where you and
I would be cold-shouldered, and the society that
receives him is undoubtedly very high and good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
society. Moreover, the Respectable million,
though they may roll their eyes unctuously at
his misconduct, would be extremely delighted to
have the honour of entertaining Lord A. at
afternoon tea. You know perfectly well, my
friend, that his lordship is "a gentleman bred
and born," and that circles closed to B., an impecunious
artist, but a man of exemplary deportment
and refinement of feeling, are open to
Lord A.</p>

<p>I hold that the terms lady and gentleman, like
the word Respectable, have become grossly perverted,
and are now merely the connotations of
an odious snobbery. I would like to see the
phrases deleted from every dictionary. In their
original sense they were good words, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>gentle</i>-man
and <i>gentle</i>-woman, or if you will, lady. But
they are now utterly corrupt and meaningless,
except when applied to the vulgar of all ranks.
The lady who does washing calls for the woman's
linen. The cant term has become the privileged
title of the vulgarest plebeian. An ignorant,
ill-mannered, middle-class woman dubs herself
Lady, and describes her cultured governess as a
Person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Diogenes went about with a lantern looking
for a man. Some of us are questing for those
mythical personages known as ladies and gentlemen;
and, like Mrs. Gamp, who doubted the
existence of Mrs. 'Arris, we are feign to believe
"there aint no sich a person." When the majority
disagree as to the outward semblance and
the inner attributes of "real gentlefolk," how can
we distinguish individuals of the order?</p>

<p>At a flower show I once overheard the
daughter of a provincial solicitor remark to her
"lady" friend: "My dear, there is really <i>no
one</i> here but us." I looked around, and saw
"bankers and brewers, men of evil omen," with
their resplendent wives and daughters, and a
great number of social small-fry. But these
were nobodies. They were not lawyers, or the
sons and daughters of lawyers, therefore they
were nonentities. How quaint are the invidious
distinctions and the usages of Snobbery! For
example, it is considered impertinence if a brewer
follows the hounds in a scarlet coat, but a banker
may wear the "pink and buckskins." Such, at
any rate, is the unwritten law in some hunting
districts. As for army snobbishness, it is well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
known that in several regiments the impecunious
officer, not "up to" the extravagant "form" of
the mess, is regarded as a cad by brainless,
swaggering subalterns, whose expenditure on
their stomachs amounts to several hundred
pounds per annum. But to write upon the
inflated Respectability of "the Service" would
require a separate section of this essay. It is
enough to say that the bullying, blustering military
Respectable is usually a scion of a <i>parvenu</i>
family. The type is not only to be found in the
regular forces; it is very common in the county
militia and in the provincial volunteer corps. A
son of a wine merchant, or some other prosperous
tradesman, secures a lieutenancy in the volunteers,
and soon rises to a higher rank. He is an
officer, and therefore a "gentleman;" and he
lords it over other tradesmen and tradesmen's
sons with the air of a patrician major-general.
One of these precious jackanapes once abused
me for a "civilian," and threatened me with "an
orderly," in a raucous tone of wrath, because I
inadvertently trespassed within the lines of a
volunteer camp. I said: "Where is the orderly?
I'll wait for him," and I sat down on the grass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
and smoked my pipe, and summoned fortitude
for the awful tribunal of a court-martial. But
the orderly came not, though the "civilian"
waited long and patiently.</p>

<p>Much as I dislike slang, I find the cant terms
"side" and "bounce" so admirably adapted to
my purpose in delineating certain phases of
Respectability that I may perhaps be pardoned
for using them in this attempt at a scientific
exposition. Side and bounce will carry you far
in Respectable society. Self-assertiveness is an
excellent thing. Johnson and Carlyle were born
with the faculty; they knew how to inspire awe,
and no one dared to contradict them. The
Yankees call this quality "side." They say that
an egotistical, swaggering, dominant man "puts
on a lot of side." Many men and women make
their way to Respectability by putting on side.
The rules are: (1) To appear to know all about
everything. (2) to talk in a loud voice, and to
interrupt other speakers. (3) to push, jostle, and
trample upon the weak, the very young, and the
diffident. The man who observes these rules is
sure to get on in the world.</p>

<p>Have you not seen the crowd cower like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
frightened sheep at the sound of a self-important
voice? If you wish to get the better of your
brother man, you must terrify him and awe him
into admiration. There is a good story of Colonel
Burnaby. He was once speaking on a political
platform, and some dissentients made a hubbub,
and shouted "Chuck him out!" Burnaby knew
the value of "side." He walked down to the
menacing rowdies, asked one of them for a light,
sat down among them, and smoked his pipe.</p>

<p>We may not love bumptious, thrusting mortals,
who make their brother men their stepping-stones
to higher things. But we are all more or
less envious of their success; and we are always
giving way to them, and making their path easy
and pleasant. When we see a pompous personage
walking grandly up Pall Mall, and gazing
scorn upon the vulgar herd, we are often tempted
to step up to him and say, as Douglas Jerrold, or
someone else, once said to one of these superior
persons: "Pray, sir, are you anyone in particular?"
But we don't do it. We wither beneath
the glassy stare of an eye-glass.</p>

<p>Some men are born with "side." It is easy and
natural to them. As children they are never the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
horse, but always the driver when playing at
horses, and at school they become cocks of the
walk and chiefs of the dormitories. They are
destined to be highly respected among the Respectables,
for the rank and file of Respectability
like to be dominated.</p>

<p>The other day I read a letter from a young
English Respectable settled in South Africa. He
wrote: "You have no idea how much time it
takes to kick sense into nigger servants." Glorious
British supremacy! That is the way to
plant the banner of civilisation in heathen lands.</p>

<p>In a modern comedy which I have seen played
(I forget the title), a flunkey who inherits an unexpected
fortune, thumps the table with his fist,
crying, "Now I'll be a gentleman! I'll be a
<i>gentleman</i>, by God!" You will possibly try to
convince me that this fellow never could become
a gentleman. Why not? Money makes the
man. He may not be a <i>gentle</i>-man in <i>your</i> sense,
but he is a <i>gentleman</i> in the estimation of an
immense number of the "general public." Do
not dupe yourself with the notion that there is
only one kind of gentleman in the community.
There are at least a dozen sorts&mdash;the true gentleman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the real gentleman, my idea of a gentleman,
your idea of a gentleman, Mrs. Grundy's
gentleman, the Veneering conception of a gentleman,
the Oxford University definition of a
gentleman, the crack cavalry notion of a gentleman,
the county society idea of a gentleman, the
gentleman who keeps a shop, but is too gentlemanly
to sell you things over the counter, the
natural gentleman, the born gentleman, the
gentlemanlike person, and so on. Is there no
room for Jeames in this mixed assemblage?
Once and for all, clear your mind of the fallacy
that your especial conception of a gentleman is
the <i>only</i> true one. There are, fortunately, not
one, but several standards of feminine beauty.
There are also several criteria of the real gentleman
and the perfect lady.</p>

<p>Turn to the dictionary for a "correct definition"
of gentleman if you wish to fog your mind
still more upon this subject: "Gentleman (from
<i>genteel</i> and <i>man</i>)&mdash;In a general sense, every educated
person above a labourer, an artisan, or a
tradesman, an individual possessed of the conduct,
habit, and outward appearance which
belong, or are expected to belong, to persons born
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and educated in a high social position; a man in
any station of life who is possessed of good breeding
and refined manners, strict integrity and
honour, kindliness of heart, and suchlike qualities;
in a limited sense, a person of good fortune
and good family, whether titled or not; one who
bears a coat of arms; a term of complaisance or
respect, as in the plural <i>gentlemen</i>, when addressing
a number of persons." Does this hotchpotch
of contradiction help you in determining
the qualities of a gentleman? I confess it is of
no service to me.</p>

<p>No, we must end this disquisition as we began
it. Terminology merely bewilders and frustrates
clear thought on the question. There is obviously
room and to spare for all of us in the temple
of gentility. We can all be gentlemen and
ladies if we choose. The only thing to decide is,
which sort? Personally, I feel honoured at
being spoken of as "that man." "I endeavour,"
writes M. Taine, "rightly to comprehend the epithet
so essential 'a gentleman'; it constantly
recurs, and comprises a mass of ideas wholly
English.... In France we have not the word,
because we have not the things, and these three

<p>Women are particularly susceptible to the
disease of Respectability. Our sisters esteem
rank and birth; they bow down to all kinds of
idols with a veneration seldom equalled in men.
Form, ceremonies, modes of dress, points of etiquette,
and social observances mean more to them
than to us; and it is difficult to prove to them the
hollowness and inutility of mere seems, because
externals satisfy their sense of decorum and give
them pleasure. The average <i>bourgeois</i> woman
reads the court news and aristocratic tittle-tattle
with avidity mingled with envy. Baubles, insignia,
uniforms, and the pomps of officialdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
attract and dazzle her, and she would rather know
a stupid peer than a sage, unpretentious philosopher,
man of science, or poet.</p>

<p>Notice the large proportion of women in the
crowds that gather outside a West End mansion,
or at the door of a church, on the occasions
of a ball or a fashionable wedding. Many
women will travel long distances, and endure
severe fatigue and discomfort to gain a transitory
glimpse at titled personages. Lacking the
power of analysis, and being deficient in imagination,
they admire the popular and ostentatious,
and contemn the persons and the things of true
worth. Besides this, women's sense of humour
is less keen than that of men; they fail to see
the droll side of customs and fetishes, and they
get angry with those who jest and chuckle at
grotesque ceremonies and functions. It matters
not to the middle-class woman how good or wise
a man or woman may be if they do not conform
to preposterous codes and usages.</p>

<p>The romantic youth who imagines that most
women are more sentimental and romantic than
himself, discovers his error when he becomes a
lover, and is received as a suitor in the family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of his inamorata. He finds the Little Muddleton
Road folk extremely practical and respectable.
Materfamilias may possibly have been slightly
tinged with romance and poetry in her teens;
but at fifty she is a slave to Respectability, and
she teaches her daughters, in season and out, that
they must, before all else, be "Respectable members
of society." Is it a matter for wonder?
Naturally, the romantic youth puzzles over this
shrewd, business-like phase of woman's character;
but he forgets that "human beings, cramped
under worse than South Sea Isle taboo," develop
astuteness in order to survive. You cannot
expect women who have been fenced around by
Respectability and restricted to the back parlour
and the kitchen, to be wild, free, natural
creatures, and nymphs of the woodland. We
ought not to have imprisoned them in this way at
the beginning. By this time, alas! the majority
of them appear to hug their fetters.</p>

<p>The black shadow of the plague of Respectability
is over love and the relations of the sexes,
and women suffer more than men from this
terrible blight. Respectability isolates the sexes
before marriage, and only allows them to discover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
each other's idiosyncracies, caprices, and
foibles when they are inseparably united ankle to
ankle and wrist to wrist, to hobble on through
life, and pretend that they are enjoying the
penance. I do not say that the shackles <i>always</i>
gall. It is almost a sheer question of chance if
they do not. For this fearful uncertainty Respectability
is much to blame. Girls are immured
and guarded, like vestal virgins of old;
there is no wholesome widespread social commingling
of the sexes. Boys are free; but what
is their liberty worth to them, when girls are
watched, chaperoned, and secluded at the very
age when their society is most sought by the
youth of the opposite sex? This nunnery system
is practically restricted to the middle-class Respectables.
What is its effect upon the morals
and the weal of the order? Most disastrous.
The young man, in a very large number of
instances, gains his knowledge of womankind
among the flashy, flighty, and even more undesirable
specimens of the sex. He meets the Little
Muddleton Road girls at parties occasionally, but
if he walks home from chapel with one of them,
Paterfamilias or Mamma intervenes, and cuts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
short the friendship, or they want to know the
young fellow's "intentions" towards Ethel. His
own parents tell him he is too youthful, or too
poor, to think of wooing yet; and I have even
known mothers who excluded all girls from the
house for fear that their sons should fall in love
prematurely.</p>

<p>Now, it is quite probable that the young man
has no "intentions," beyond gaining a friend in
one of the Little Muddleton Road girls. He may
simply desire social intercourse with one of the
feminine kind, out of obedience to an eternal and
immutable law of attraction. But no, such intimacies,
unless they are distinctly understood to
be the prelude to marriage, are rarely permitted
by the Respectables. "It is not proper for Ethel
to be seen about with that young Simpkins.
What will Mrs. Robinson think?" Therefore
Ethel is interdicted from communication with the
estimable Simpkins, and injured propriety is
appeased and quieted.</p>

<p>I say without hesitation that such isolation is
ruinous to the morals of the community. Finding
how exceedingly difficult it is to associate
with the daughters of the Respectables, young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Simpkins finds companions among the female
outcasts of society, women who besmirch his
romance, and degrade his pure passion to the
lowest animal lust. The world is full of love,
could he but find it; but Respectability locks it
up in fusty dens, and says: "You mustn't be a
close friend of my daughter. That will never do!
If you were engaged to her it would be a different
matter; but you're not, and people would talk."
So Simpkins goes away, and "picks up" very
questionable girls in the street, and buys his first
experience of "love." And the saddest thing is
that he forms his opinion about women from
these types, which is, of course, unwise, to say the
least. But is he wholly to blame for this? No,
he is one of the victims of Respectability, the
grim tyrant who mars and blasts millions of
human lives in England. At thirty-five Simpkins
is a <i>blasé</i>, cynical young man-about-town, a
sufferer, probably, from inordinate sexuality,
with a profound contempt for all women, founded
on his miserable experiences with female harpies
and panders. "A fool and sinner," cries the
moralist. Yes, but there are many like to him
amongst us; and they were once decent, healthy,
chivalrous young men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>And what of the isolated young girl? Her
case seems to me even more sorrowful and piteous.
Half of life is a sealed book to her. She has
scarcely any ideas that are not delusions about
love and the opposite sex, and the most important
offices of her being. Her natural impulses have
been suppressed, stunted, and perverted, and her
physical health is probably feebler than that of
the dissipated young man. She marries late,
dazed with joy that her hour has come at last,
and frequently awakes in the first year of marriage
to the truth that she knew little about men
in general, and not nearly enough about the man
she has wedded; that she was wofully inexperienced
and ignorant, and that Respectability condemns
her to drain the bitter cup of disappointment
to the dregs, to drain it with composure and
a smiling face to the world. She was not allowed
to mix freely with men. All her ideas of male
human nature are derived from mawkish novels
and story books, often written by women as ill-informed
as herself. Many women have confessed
to me that they did not understand men
till they married one, and many men have said
the same concerning women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>How, then, can we lessen the chances of drawing
the wrong card in the great lottery of marriage?
Certainly not by the sequestration of
youths and maidens, for that is one of the chief
causes of unsuccessful unions. Grundyism and
Respectability must be set at defiance, and boys
and girls in adolescence allowed to form companionships
with each other. The artificial
barriers between them must be broken down;
the old stupid inhibitions rescinded, and a wholesome
association not only permitted, but by every
means encouraged. Education in life through
the fellowship and the interchange of ideas
between the sexes is one safeguard against wreckage
in the perilous journey of matrimony.</p>

<p>Discoursing upon the "eternal feminine,"
Schopenhauer says: "Individual and partial exceptions
do not alter the fact that women are, and
will always remain, the most thorough and incurable
Philistines.... Their domination and
influence ruins modern society.... The essentially
European lady is a being who ought to
have no existence at all; there ought, on the
other hand, to be housewives and girls who hope
to become such, and who are, in consequence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
brought up to domesticity by subordination.
Just because there are <i>ladies</i> in Europe, women
of a lower grade, who form, therefore, the great
majority of the sex, are much more unhappy than
they are in the East."</p>

<p>As to the charge of Philistinism, I am, unfortunately,
compelled to agree with the pessimistic
mysogynist. Women are the larger part
of humanity in this country, and, that part being
Philistine, it must exercise a bad influence upon
society in the mass. I do not deny that the
spirit of rebellion lurks in every woman's breast,
but, for all that, women are not readily persuaded
to rebel against absurd conventions.
Their great desire is to be on the popular side,
and in the ranks of the mightier force, because
unpopular causes are generally accounted discreditable
by the majority. Women, therefore,
set a high value on Respectability, and they endure
much suffering to maintain it. Yet here
and there we find women as leaders and foremost
fighters in assaults upon irrational institutions
and customs, and they are often wise tacticians
and valorous assailers. But such women are not
of the Respectables; they are thinkers and reformers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
who have cast aside the cumbrous, tawdry
trappings of that order, so that they may be of
service to humanity. The Philistine woman
cares little or nothing for social advance and the
welfare of posterity, and in this respect she is
always rather more apathetic or actively hostile
to progress than the Philistine man. She feels
that a woman has more to lose than a man by
abandoning conventionalities and orthodox
opinions. But this dread is somewhat ill-founded
and exaggerated, because there are many unconventional
men only too ready to warmly welcome
the women who revolt, and not only to bid them
cheer, but to pay them high homage for their
bravery and independence. In the long run, a
woman gains far more esteem and friendship in
the army of the Unconventionalists than she wins
from the host of the Respectables.</p>

<p>Timidity is one of the prime sources of the disease
of Respectability in both sexes, and women
are by nature more timid than men in the matter
of revolt against ignorant Public Opinion. The
result is that women are much less free than men
in so-called free countries. "A man glories in
being considered bold, but a woman shrinks from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the charge of boldness, as degrading to her sex."
<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
And here I shelter myself behind a doughty
champion of women, because if I wrote the indictment
which he has set down, my ethical-cum-philosophical
Gamaliel, and possibly many of my
women readers, would charge me with "cynicism"
and "sex-bias." I quote again from Mr. Gibson,
who, in this charge of the alleged untruthfulness
of women, is almost as emphatic as Schopenhauer:
"Owing to the subordinate position of
women, <i>they are less truthful than men</i>. They
work up to their ends without the exercise of
force, and must therefore use guile. Men lie as
readily as women when they think lies will serve
their purpose, but, having more freedom, and
being less afraid of conflict, they have less cause
to lie. <i>Women are taught to lie from their childhood,
in order to hide their desires, their disappointments,
and their sufferings.</i> Women are
driven in upon themselves, and in sheer self-defence
lie as men are not called upon to lie."
<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>I know several charming women who lie most
glibly and as to the manner born, without a tinge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of shame; indeed, it is a difficult matter to make
sure that you have "got them," so to speak, for
their speech is so slippery, and they fib so artistically
that no reliance can be placed upon their
admissions of belief or disbelief in this or that.
All that they say must be swallowed with a large
grain of salt. But let me qualify this impugnment
somewhat. I think we may fairly say that
the tarradiddles of women are not generally of
the more ignoble order of lies. They are mostly
pretty little semi-transparent falsehoods which do
not utterly deceive the hearer who has studied the
psychology of women. It is Respectability that
makes cowards and cozeners of men and women;
and those who imagine that they have the most
to lose by frankness will naturally practice the
most deception.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The woman-thrall to convention
is forced to use the weapons of falsehood and
to don the armour of deceit. In corroboration of
this assertion, I shall again quote the words of
another writer, and a woman to boot. Miss
Violet Hunt, a clever satiric novelist, thus describes
the unhappy girl who has been inoculated
with the virus of Respectability:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<p class="bq">"How one knows the kind of girl! One meets a specimen
in almost every house-party. She is nicely dressed,
but not quite so nicely as the other girls staying in the
house. She has charming manners, but there is something
of the offensive and defensive sharpness of the
street Arab about her. She has had to take care of herself
ever since she was grown up, and make her tongue
do the work of chaperonage. If it rains, she is in mute
agony, because she cannot afford to spoil her clothes.
She takes Champagne regularly at dinner because she
does not have it at home. She is at some pains to propitiate
her hostess, because she intends to be asked
again. She holds her tongue when grand functions are
mentioned, because she was not there. In short, she is a
kind of innocent whited sepulchre; a frail, jerry-built
edifice, whose prestige may be destroyed at any moment
by untoward revelations as to her social standing, whose
whole endeavour is to give the impression that she lives
in a mentionable part of London, and dresses on more
than thirty pounds a year."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>This is a pitiless exposure of the shifts and
subterfuges to which you must stoop in posing as
a lady or gentleman, when you are only a person.
What happiness, what profit, come out of such
masquerading? It is better, a hundred times
better, to save your soul alive, and preserve something
of self-respect, as one of the unreceived and
unrecognised Non-Respectables. You will find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
this enchanted garden of Philistia, fenced with
high walls bristling with spikes, and set with
warning boards, is a very shoddy Paradise when
you are admitted to it on sufferance. It is the
domain of the "bores and bored," the haunt of
parasites and toadies, incessantly scheming and
distrusting each other in a deadly dull atmosphere
of uncongeniality.</p>

<p>My sister, you gain <i>nothing</i> by fostering this
malady of Respectability, by vapouring and
wasting your sweetness in the aridity of the
Little Muddleton Road. So long as you slavishly
conform to the barbaric customs and codes
of that wretched clan, so long will you be abject
and unhappy. Come out of the fetid air of the
Charnel-house of Convention, rip off those corsets
and cramping disguises, cast away your high-heeled
boots, and stand erect and fearless among
men and women who dare to live free uncontaminated
lives, beyond the reek and blight of
the infected purlieus.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="ac larger">RESPECTABILITY AND MORALS.</p>

<div class="bq">Mrs. Alving: Oh! that perpetual law and order! I often think it is that
which does all the mischief here in the world. "Ghosts."</div>

<div class="bq ar">
<span class="sc">Ibsen.</span></div>

<div class="bq">"Reputation is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without
merit."</div>

<div class="bq ar">
"<span class="sc">Othello.</span>"</div>


<p>That which people call thorough Respectability
is, in the main, very bad morality. I do
not state that the disease under discussion invariably
annihilates the subject's sense of justice,
integrity, and charity, but it does so in many
cases, and in the generality of instances, it certainly
perverts the ethical judgment. The true
Respectable is compelled to work out his own
social salvation and prestige by means of consistent
duplicity and craft. He must be artificial
to succeed in winning the popularity that he
craves. He has, therefore, two sets of opinions&mdash;one
for the sanctum and the other for the marketplace.
For example, to satisfy the Brownian
code, our Respectable, though he may be anti-Sabbatarian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
in private belief and practice, is
careful to dissemble his views on the question.
He probably goes to chapel, at least now and
then, in order to maintain a reputation for Respectability,
but he has been known to sneak by
devious ways to his favourite side bar at the conclusion
of his penance. Brown knows nothing
about the side bar; he gulls himself with the idea
that Smith attends Bethesda from a deep sense of
devotion.</p>

<p>But Brown is as great a humbug as Smith.
Has he not been heard to declare in private that
his regular attendance at chapel is a matter of
business? And, as for Robinson, does he not
absent himself from service whenever he is
beyond the espionage of the Little Muddleton
Road clan? I have even seen him fishing at
Datchet on Sunday. I do not wonder
that these three worthies distrust each
other in trading. Each one is conscious
in fleeting moments of honest self-introspection
that the man who habitually deceives
his neighbours concerning his religious,
political, and social opinions, is scarcely the one
to practise strict commercial probity. Nor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
indeed, is he. Respectables who dupe their
neighbours as to their moral and intellectual
beliefs and convictions are just as likely to defraud
them in business transactions, and I have
never met an intellectual liar who was scrupulously
truthful and upright in his business
affairs.</p>

<p>A man, for one reason or another, emotional or
purely expedient, wishes to believe, or to persuade
his acquaintances that he believes, certain theological
doctrines, and, by a process of deliberate
stultification of his reason, he may actually cajole
himself that he <i>does</i> believe them. Is this the
kind of man who will sedulously guard against
soiling his hands in dirty commercial enterprises?
I think not. If he deceives you about
his private views, and plays the mental poltroon
and hypocrite in public, you may be almost certain
that he adulterates his bread, or sells his
customers American Cheddar, assuring them that
it is of English make. We cannot draw a sharp
line of distinction betwixt intellectual and moral
dishonesty. The man who pretends to have
Radical leanings, when he is at heart a Tory, is
the man who will probably swindle you in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
way of trade. A trimmer and an opportunist is
to be distrusted all round.</p>

<p>Respectability, like emasculation, makes men
cowardly, untruthful, and mean-spirited. It is a
terrible moral and mental blight upon the community.
Do you not know the unctuous provincial
tradesfolk who never attend their local
theatres for fear of the Puritans of Little Peddlington?
I have known scores of them&mdash;aye,
and seen them with my own eyes at the Alhambra
and other places of entertainment in London.
They don't spend all their holiday in town at
Exeter Hall and the City Temple. I need not say
any more about these unmitigated impostors;
but this passage from Ibsen's "Ghosts" will not
be an inapt illustration of their slyness:&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq">"Manders: What! Do you mean to say that respectable
men from home here would&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p class="bq">"Oswald: Have you never heard these respectable
men, when they got home again, talking about the way
in which immorality was getting the upper hand abroad?</p>

<p class="bq">"Manders: Yes, of course.</p>

<p class="bq">"Mrs. Alving: I have, too.</p>

<p class="bq">"Oswald: Well, you may take their word for it. They
know what they are talking about! (Presses his hands to
his head). Oh! that that great, free, glorious life out
there should be defiled in such a way!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>When Respectability has a strong hold on a
man's moral sense, there is no low crime that it
may not lead him to commit. Respectables, like
the congenital criminals described by Lombroso,
almost invariably profess religion, and many are
outwardly very devout, but full within of ravening
and venality. "He shows the whites of his
eyes on the Sabbath, and the blacks all the rest
of the week," says Thoreau. When the plate is
passed around after divine service, the Respectable
ostentatiously deposits a florin upon it,
registering a secret vow that he will get back
that coin, with ample interest, by some shady
trick of trade on Monday morning. He gets it,
too, you may be sure, and with a swinging profit
on it, in consideration of his Sabbath generosity.
There may be treasure laid up in heaven for the
Respectable, but he is not the fool to despise the
good things of this life. He believes that all
things have been given unto him richly to enjoy,
here and hereafter, and he takes care that none
of these good things go by mistake to the wrong
quarters. His golden rule is, obtain from others
all that you can. However latitudinarian he
may be upon some points of doctrine, he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
strictly orthodox in the application of that useful
text, "Blessed are the poor." "Decent Society"
is full of these whited sepulchres; their dank,
poisonous stench pervades every Little Muddleton
Road in the Kingdom.</p>

<p>I like to hear the working man speak his mind
on the Respectables. The British working man
has his palpable faults and failings, but he is
most often free from the disease of Respectability.
He knows worth of character when he sees it, and
he detests the two-faced dealings, snobbishness,
and cant of his self-styled superiors. The
British working man has his failings, I say, but
he is not very seriously infected with Respectability,
except in rare instances. He is a cleaner,
much more moral man than the <i>bourgeois</i>, and
considerably more intelligent as a rule, because
he is under no social necessity to lie to his better
judgment and juggle with his reason. The proletariat,
like the aristocratic class, have obtained
a tolerable liberty of opinion and conduct. They
can afford to be Non-Respectables, and they
possess the pluck to be honest thinkers. And one
can say this without having a profound veneration
for "noble lords" and the institution of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
peerage, and without intending to whitewash
blackguards, whether they be mere patricians or
simple costermongers. A friends of mine, a man
of feeling, once sojourned for a space in the home
of a provincial linen-draper of eminent, Respectability.
I don't know what my friend was doing
in that galley; I can't explain the juxtaposition
of a Man of Feeling in such company; but it is
enough to say that my eccentric friend was there.
Well, the highly Respectable linen-draper was
likewise "very religious," as the phrase is, and
he used continually to dwell upon the importance
of devotional exercise, as most Respectables do.
He read Scripture aloud to his family and assistants,
went to chapel regularly, observed Sunday
scrupulously, behind drawn window blinds,
believed in small profits and quick returns, drove
a good trade, and held his head high, for the
sober, God-fearing, enterprising shopkeeper that
he was. At meal times this fellow would hold
forth on grace&mdash;a virtue in which he was
strangely lacking&mdash;also on obeying the precepts
of Christ. "Ah," he would say, rolling the
yellows of his greedy little eyes; "ah, that I were
more like the Master!" Now, this speech incessantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
on the lips of a sweater and a hypocrite
began to cause the Man of Feeling's gorge to rise,
for he was a healthy, decent liver, and a hater of
cant. So one day, when the Respectable lifted
his gaze to the ceiling and muttered his usual
aspiration, the Man of Feeling could endure the
sickening ordeal no longer.</p>

<p>"Like the Master!" he cried vehemently.
"You wish to be like the Master, and you pay
your female assistants eight or ten shillings a
week, and expect them to live on that miserable
sum! Don't insult Christ! Don't cant and pretend
that you wish to be a penniless socialist, and
go about trying to do good. <i>You!</i>" And, with
these words, the Man of Feeling arose, and left
that Respectable house, shaking its dust from his
feet, and panting to breathe once more a pure and
bracing air among the Non-Respectables, to
whom, by moral conviction, he rightly belonged.</p>

<p>Ah! "the mud-hearted Bourgeois!" I don't
wonder that another Man of Feeling, poor,
sensitive, pitying, indignant Francis Adams,
called you by that title! Can you by any human
power be dragged out of the slime in which you
love to wallow?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet these are the censors of genius, the founders
of public taste, the friends of religion, the conservers
of morality, forsooth! Every little
shallow, mean-souled Respectable thinks himself
capable of deciding that Shelley and Burns were
"immoral;" that this or that work of genius is
"injurious to morals;" that one brilliant man is
morally incapacitated from assisting in legislation,
and that another ought to be imprisoned for
the expression of heterodox religious or political
opinions. British Respectability makes Britain
the laughing-stock and butt of the wits of the
world. Nay, more; the Respectable's stupid
blatant "patriotism" and bullying arrogance
cause us to be hated in all the quarters of the
globe.</p>

<p>I repeat that Respectability is practically incompatible
with moral worth. With true, sound,
broad morality it is quite incompatible. You
cannot grow grapes on thorn bushes, nor force
lilies among stinging-nettles. Politics, commerce,
the relations of the sexes, science, art, and
literature, are all more or less corrupted by the
mephitic blight of Respectability.</p>

<p>I will conclude this chapter with a quotation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
from M. Taine, who estimates our insular propriety
very shrewdly in his entertaining "Notes
on England." "I am acquainted with a London
merchant who visits Paris twice yearly on business.
When he is there he is very jovial, and
amuses himself on Sunday as freely as anyone
else. His Paris host, who visited him at his
home in London, where he was made thoroughly
welcome, going downstairs on Sunday to the
room where there was a miniature billiard table,
pushed the balls about on it. The merchant in
alarm begged him to stop at once, saying, 'The
neighbours will be scandalised should they hear
this.'"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="ac larger">CULTURED GENTILITY.</p>

<div class="bq">"I hardly know an <i>intellectual</i> man, even, who is
so broad and truly liberal
that you can think aloud in his society. Most with whom you endeavour to
talk soon come to a stand against some institution in which they appear to
hold stock&mdash;that is some particular, not universal way of viewing things."</div>

<div class="bq ar">
<span class="sc">Thoreau.</span></div>

<div class="bq">"Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?"</div>

<div class="bq ar">
"<span class="sc">Measure for Measure.</span>"</div>


<p>Cultured gentility is one of the signs of the
times. Snobbishness is a deep-seated vice of
human beings, and a trait of the gregarious
mammalia, with which the human snob, when he
is more than ordinarily ignorant, disclaims relationship.
When Darwin told people that their
early progenitors were hairy and ape-like, with
prehensile feet, great canine teeth, and tails
equipped with the proper muscles, all the Respectables
jeered at him, and said that they were
"only a little lower than the angels," and that
monkeys must have been fashioned as travesties
of men. But though we have moved upwards,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
"working out of the beast," Man still exhibits
race prejudice, patriotic bias, and the low instinct
of class exclusiveness. Perhaps at no period of
our social evolution have we been more cultured,
and yet more vulgar, than at the present time.
Such a juxtaposition may appear to indicate that
a little knowledge for the masses is not without
its disadvantages as well as its blessing. The
proletarian of the sixteenth century could not
read nor write; but he was probably less vulgar
than those among his descendants whose acquaintance
with modern literature is restricted to
the gutter library of cuts and snips and racing
tips. Simple, merry Dick trolled "Old Rose";
flash 'Arry and his blatant mates hiccough the
staccato of "Glorious Beer."</p>

<p>Contemporaneous with a widespread vulgarity
of thought and a hideous banality of living,
there is an immense development of culture.
Nowadays it is the fashion to "go in" for
"culture," and in society you must know, or
affect to know, something about evolution, the
higher criticism, Ibsen, Whistler's pictures, and
Chippendale furniture. You may learn much
about these, and be "smart" at the same time;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
for smartness and culture go hand-in-hand to the
"crushes" and "at homes," and are as brother
and sister one to the other. To use a phrase from
the vocabulary of culture-cum-smartness, you
are "not in the running" if you have merely
mastered the theory of the universal germ, and
neglected to practise the skirt dance or the plantation
song.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, the philosopher and the man
of letters came out and was separate from
amongst the crowd. He lived mostly in the seclusion
of his library, which was neither good for
his understanding nor his digestion. But he
forewent the pomps of smart society, partly
because smart society did not wish to be bored,
and partly owing to his enlightened instinct of
Bohemianism, which found wholesome gratification
in the unostentatious amenities of the
literary symposium, the forgathering with one or
two of his craft at the historic "Cheshire
Cheese" or the "Cock Tavern." He dressed
himself with a certain careless distinction;
he drank cider with Porson, and
spent ambrosial nights in the fumes from
churchwardens with genial Lamb, Hazlitt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Godwin, Leigh Hunt, and Landor. These were
men of culture who refused to hover on the fringe
of a shallow, fashionable society, not because they
were intellectual snobs, but because their pursuits
were on a higher plane than the frivolities
of Respectability.</p>

<p>Wordsworth dwelt remote among the hills;
De Quincey led laborious days in the solitude of
Mavis Bush; Shelley lived unknown of his
neighbours at Marlow; and Landor, "a noble-looking
old man, badly dressed in shabby snuff-clothes,
a dirty old blue necktie and unstarched
cotton shirt," lived chiefly aloof in Florence.
None of these qualified themselves for lionisation
in society. The arts of gentility are not compatible
with the study of science and philosophy.</p>

<p>Ampère, the scientific investigator, went one
day to dine with Madame Beauregard. His
hands were stained by a drug which leaves its
mark on the skin for several days. Poor Ampère!
what did he in a company where externals count
for all a man is worth? His hostess could not
dine with one whose hands were soiled in the
interest of posterity: "I promised not to return
there before my hands were white. Of course,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
I shall never enter the house again," wrote
Ampère to his wife. And have we not read how
Dr. Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds were mistaken
by a finical lady for a pair of working
men when she saw them conversing together?</p>

<p>But we have fallen upon different days. The
philosopher has been lured from his den; the
poets have come down from Parnassus to sport
with the nymphs of Philistia, the intellectual
rogue elephant has been tamed to "caper nimbly
in my lady's chamber," and the recusant and the
pariah sat down to table with the imposing dignitaries
of the Church and State. It may be well
on the whole, but these gracious concessions
from the Philistine are not without their perils
for the philosopher and the artist. Even the
wisest of them cannot always escape the moral
and mental deterioration that comes of being <i>au
fait</i> in the whiffles and frothy small talk of drawing-rooms,
the parlour tricks and pretty deportments;
and the donning of a chimney-pot hat and
a dress coat is often the first step on the downward
career of the intellectual. Have we not seen
it? One season will transform the modest, single-hearted,
plain-living artist or student into a vain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
insufferable, intellectual mountebank. A few
months of interviewing, and "log-rolling," and
posturing in Mayfair, and you change your ideas,
stultify your conscience, and degenerate into a
Respectable. It is almost inevitable. We are
all sweetly human, and vanity is one of our prime
characteristics. Most of us, also, as some critic
of life observes, would rather be "the chief of
a committee of four than the unknown benefactor
of our species." An author of mediocre ability,
possessing that quality of self-assertiveness
known commonly as "side," can far outpace the
shy genius in the race for public esteem. The
brazen bumptiousness and supercilious disdain of
the mere talent which lacks astute worldly
wisdom are the components of the snobbishness
that makes for social success. Society closes the
door upon the needy philosopher in his threadbare
garb; but it throws its portals wide to
welcome the adept of claptrap, whose higher philosophy
is the study of the main chance.</p>

<p>I do not applaud the intellectual exclusiveness
with which some of the cultured attempt to keep
their immaculate souls unspotted from the world.
We want no Respectability of pedants and book-worms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Erudition is worthy of the highest
respect; but the erudite snob is imperfectly cultivated.
He is frequently more ignorant of many
important phases of life than the sheer illiterates
whom he pities for a narrowness of judgment
upon men. Who can gainsay Sir Thomas
Browne, when he writes: "It is an unjust way of
compute to magnify a weak head for some Latin
abilities; and to under-value a solid judgment
because he knows not the genealogy of Hector"?
It is difficult to dissociate arrogance from ignorance,
even when we know that the arrogant man
is learned. Snobbishness is a mark of shallowness.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, many men and women of genius
have evinced the specific snobbery of culture.
Shakspere, Jonson, Victor Hugo, and Turguenieff,
are great figures that suggest exceptions
to the rule. Carlyle is a bad case of playing
to the Respectables; for, despite his loudly-proclaimed
reverence for humanity, his vanity,
like that of Antisthenes, peered through the rents
in his cloak. In extolling the imposers of brute
force in the community, the sage displayed a
tendency to cajole the oppressing class, for whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
he had about as much real sympathy as the
Southerner has for the negro race. He jeered at
and snubbed his contemporary writers; he despised
mere literary artists; he told a now eminent
novelist that he was "ganging to the de'il by the
very vulgarest road"; he described Lecky as
"a willow-pattern sort o' man, voluble but harmless,
a pure herbivorous, nay, mere graminivorous
creature;" he called Landor a "wild man," and
sighed "over the spectacle of the commonplace
torn to rags;" Maurice was "uninteresting ...
twisted, screwed, wiredrawn;" and it is
said that the most he could say for George Meredith
was that he was "nae fule." To a host of
minor essayists, journalists, and literary hangers-on,
Carlyle set that fashion of priggishness and
snobbery that prevails so widely at the present
time.</p>

<p>What a mighty and fearsome foe to knowledge
is Academic Respectability. Beneath its sway
the seats of learning become fusty abiding-places
of mouldy pedantry. It posts its wary lackeys
at every avenue of research to warn back adventurous
explorers, with their theological or political
red flags and notice boards. Academic Respectability
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
expelled Shelley. It frowns upon
Bain, Francis Newman, and other bold investigators
and scholars of modern times. It killed
Socrates, persecuted Spinoza, insulted David
Hume, sneered at Buckle, and derided Darwin.
De Quincey tells us that he scarcely spoke to a
soul while he was at Worcester College, Oxford.
Was the pensive opium-eater thoroughly overawed
or depressed by the Respectability of the
classic city? Possibly those were the days of the
genesis of the "Oxford manner," that supercilious
drawling affectation of superior sapience
which characterises the sons of <i>bourgeois</i> families
at Alma Mater.</p>

<p>Let William Morris speak: "Oxford was
beautiful even in the nineteenth century, when
Oxford, and its less interesting sister, Cambridge,
became definitely commercial. They (and
especially Oxford) were the breeding places of a
peculiar class of parasites, who called themselves
cultivated people; they were, indeed, cynical
enough, as the so-called educated classes of the
day generally were; but they affected an exaggeration
of cynicism, in order that they might be
thought knowing and worldly-wise." ("News
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
from Nowhere.") Thomas Hardy, in describing
the manners of Christminster,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> writes in a similar
strain of the system that has elbowed the proletariat
off the pavements, to make room for the
sons of millionaires.</p>

<p>Academic stubborn opposition to new and revolutionary
theories of all kinds is one phase of the
mental malady of Respectability. All hierarchies
and autocracies have the sacrosanct seal
of Respectability; they have a conventional reputation
to maintain, and it is to their vital interest
to fight innovating opinion. For instance, the
French Academy refuses persistently to elect M.
Zola, on the very plea of his literary unconventionality
and virility. He writes for the
thoughtful and wide-visioned, and not for the
horde of shallow Respectables. Yet Zola is
beyond doubt the greatest novelist of our age;
and perhaps the only French novelist of his day
who can count upon immortality. It is his
greatness, his genius, that exclude him from the
narrow coterie. "My position is simple," he
writes. "Since there is an Academy in France,
I ought to belong to it. I have stood for election,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and I cannot recognise anything wrong on my
part in having done so. So long as I continue to
stand, I am not beaten, therefore I will always
stand." But Zola may rest well content; he has
won greater fame and honour than the Academy
could confer upon him.</p>

<p>Instance, again, the Respectable hostility to the
evolutionary theory. Was the opposition entirely
motived by a spirit of scientific scepticism
and caution? Certainly not. The main attack
was made by the army of Respectables, who became
exceedingly angry with Charles Darwin
because he calmly demolished a number of
groundless suppositions as to the origin of life,
the descent of man, and the development of the
sense of morality. Your true conventionalist,
confronted with a new and startling idea, is like
the savage who lashes himself into a passion at
the sight of a steamboat or some other mechanical
invention. The savage wants to smash the
machine and the man who made it.</p>


<p>Mr. Lawson Tait, the well-known physician,
has stated that he suffered in social and professional
life for his acceptance of the Darwinian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
hypothesis. Mr. Tait writes: "'The Origin of
Species' was published in 1859. I came across
it in 1861&mdash;as a boy of 17&mdash;it captivated me, and
took such a hold of me that I tried the application
of its principle in every direction open to
my youthful mind. In 1863, as president of the
Hunterian Medical Society (the Society of University
Students), I applied Darwin's doctrines
in directions which brought upon me the expressed
anger of the authorities, and my career
as a University student was in danger of a premature
ending. Not only was there not a single
professor of the University of Edinburgh at that
time who was other than actively hostile to Darwin's
views, but the acceptance of them actually
drove me from my native city, in 1866."</p>

<p>Such is a typical illustration of the mental
corrosion induced by the insanity of Academic
Respectability.</p>

<p>I am not tilting at Universities, but against
Respectability in every guise. With the growth
of power in the <i>bourgeois</i> class, the Universities
have, to a large degree, degenerated from halls of
knowledge into mere forcing beds of the disease
of Respectability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>The case seems even worse in "free America."</p>

<p>Plutocracy has taken the colleges under its
ægis, and knowledge has been cramped to suit the
whims of millionaire patrons. Just as happened
in the case of the academic professors who protested
against slavery, so are they now threatened
when they advocate new economic doctrines,
which do not fit in with the ideas of big capitalists.
Sensational light was thrown on this matter
by a letter written by one of the professors
of the Leland Stanford University of California,
and given to the public by the chief of the
Literary Bureau of the Democratic Bryan Party,
though its language seems to suggest that its
writer did not expect its publication. This professor
states that college professors enjoy no freedom
of expression on the money question. "I
know," he says, "there are many who wish to
champion national bi-metallism, but I am very
sure if there were such, they would be compelled to
surrender their present livelihoods." He cites by
name several instances of instructors who have
been placed under duresse for teaching views that
are considered heterodox by the wealthy men who
rule the Board of some of our principal colleges,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
and rule them in orthodox obedience to the gospel
of self-interest.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The same writer informs us that for advocating
the passage of a Bill by the Illinois State Legislature
to give the City of Chicago the option of
becoming the owner of a municipal gas plant,
and for some other exhibitions of a spirit of
economic freedom, Professor Bemis was dismissed
from his position in the University of Chicago,
an institution created and largely maintained by
a great millionaire, part of whose fortune is in
gas stock. Wisconsin has a university supported
by the people of that State, and there learning
has a chance to flourish. But wherever the influence
of the patron is found, there progress is
blocked by plutocracy.</p>

<p class="bq">"A most competent professor of political economy, in
one of the greatest of our universities, allowing himself
to become an advocate of the ownership and operation
of our telegraphs by the Government, was compelled to
give up his place by the influence of one of the trustees,
who happened to be a large owner of telegraph stock....
The victorious trustee carries about with him in
his pocket-book a little printed slip, containing the
offensive views of the discharged professor, and it is his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
pleasant habit to read this when occasion offers, to
instructors or students who may, he thinks, need bracing
up, and he accompanies the reading with cheering comments
on the fate which befel the heretic who uttered
such doctrines."</p>

<p>An important scientific school in America had
been created and endowed by one of our "poor
boys," become plutocrat. He was dissuaded with
difficulty by the President from carrying out the
idea which he proposed, that the teachers should
be hired by the month, as were the clerks in his
factories, so that they could be discharged whenever
he wanted to do so! You see, even in
democratic nations, the trail of Respectability is
over education.</p>

<p>Everyone knows Pugsley, <i>the great Pugsley</i>,
proprietor of Pugsley's Pure Piquant Pickles.
You have seen his gracefully alliterative advertisements
on the hoardings at the railway
stations, and all down the Great Turnover Line,
glaring at you in pastoral scenes, where Chloris
led her lambkins in the pre-plutocratic days of
"merrie England," and even obtruding their
hideous drawing of the pickle bottles ("Ask for
Pugsley's, Pure and Piquant") upon you in
lonely mountain inns of the Grampians. There
is no escaping the all-pervading Pugsley. Your
grocer has foisted Pugsley's Pickles on you, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
you have had to taste them, willy-nilly. He had
a good reason for sending you Pugsley's Pickles.
The firm are able to undersell all other competitors
in the drysaltery interest, because they pay
low wages to their workpeople.</p>

<p>But, though you are familiar with the name
of the Great Pugsley, and know the flavour of
his relishes and condiments, you have never
troubled to learn how the man made his huge
business. I will tell you his history. It is very
instructive.</p>

<p>Pugsley's father was a village grocer at Hookham
Nooton. He sold butter and cheese and tea
for forty years, and left his son £500 at his
demise. Young Pugsley early developed shrewd
commercial instincts. At school he retailed his
father's sugar to the boys, making a clear halfpenny
profit on each penny; and when he had
made a little capital by this huckstering, he
launched out into bigger trading ventures, such as
the vending of knives and cricket bats, and cheap
magic lanterns, till he became a kind of "Universal
Provider" at the select academy for young
gentlemen. This was good training for his after
career of buying, and selling, and exploiting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
There is nothing like beginning these things
when you are young.</p>

<p>At fifteen, Pugsley, junior, was installed
behind the parental counter at Hookham Nooton,
where he learned how to weigh tea with a bit of
paper under the scale pan, and other recognised
dodges of the trade, so that he soon became his
father's right hand, and a great acquisition to
the business. When Pugsley, senior, departed
hence, his son took sole control of the shop. But
the young man realised that he was born to be a
great merchant, and not a petty trader in a
remote village. One day he chanced upon an old
book of practical recipes, which told you how to
make ketchup and sauces, and, by dint of messing
with vinegar and spices, he hit upon the
famous blend that made his name as a sauce
maker. Bottles of the stuff sold readily in the
village and neighbouring small towns, for there
is no denying that it was a tasty relish. Then
came small wholesale orders, and trade began "to
hum," as business slang has it. Five years later
we find Pugsley the owner of a pickle factory in
Spitalfields, and the employer of fifty hands,
mostly girls and boys. Ten years after, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
pickles are used in every Respectable family in the
kingdom, and their repute has reached America
and the Colonies; and so, before the prime of
life, Pugsley is a pursy citizen, with a fine house
at Richmond, a horse and chaise, a housekeeper,
maidservants, and a gardener and coachman&mdash;all
the proper rewards of industry.</p>

<p>At thirty-six, Pugsley married money, and
further extended his business. His wife "received"
local snobs, and gave "at homes," attended
by inferior celebrities and "all the people
who are likely to be of use to us." At forty
Pugsley was a Constitutional candidate for Diddleham,
the hope of the Respectables, the cynosure
of the hide-bound conventionalists in
politics. You may remember that he was
returned by the imposing majority of six. Now
came the zenith of his fame. Pugsley's politics
like his pickles, are notoriously piquant. He has
voted against every democratic measure, and
prated about "the natural leaders of the working
class."</p>

<p>See him now, in his honoured old age, hated of
his workpeople, envied by Respectables, despised
by the county gentry and feared by almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
everyone, a millionaire to-day, with a seat in
Clodshire, a house in Portland Terrace, a yacht
at Brighton, and a deer forest in Inverness-shire.
I have met his son, the Master of the Slowcomb
Hounds, a good sort of Philistine, who would
rather do his fellow-men a good turn than an ill
one, but a terrible ignoramus and deadweight for
all that; with far less real knowledge of men
and books than my cobbler round the corner.
There are three daughters. One of them, Miss
Evelyn, is betrothed to Lord Durt, the young
impoverished peer, who was lately earning thirty
shillings a week as society reporter to the "Gadabout."
I am glad for Durt. He has had a
rough time, and Evelyn is an amiable, even
hopeful specimen of the Respectable girl. She
has lately talked about industrial questions, and
I believe she is half ashamed already that papa
has women in his employment earning nine
shillings a week upon which to keep body and
soul together.</p>

<p>Yes, it is with the sweat of women and children
that Pugsley has become a plutocrat. His
wife is the Patroness of the Refuge for the
Fallen. How many of Pugsley's women have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
been forced to supplement their wretched earnings
by prostitution? Someone once put this
question to the pickleman. "Really, Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;,"
he said, "I am not responsible for the morals of
my working people." But I say that it is such
fellows as Pugsley who force girls to sell themselves
in the street. I ask you, my Respectable
sister, could you live yourself and help to support
your widowed mother and two young children
on a wage of seven shillings a week? I have
known one of Pugsley's women workers try to do
this till death came with its eternity of rest for
that poor, semi-starved, aching body. To me it
is a constant source of wonder, and a matter of
profound respect for woman's moral courage that
more of Pugsley's ill-paid women helpers do not
walk the streets for hire.</p>

<p>O! Great Pugsley, I would that I could be certain
of a day of reckoning betwixt you and an
Almighty Judge! Sometimes, in dreams, I hear
the tramp, tramp, of thousands of feet, and see
the white faces of toilers gleam in the murk of a
London night, a night of violent retribution.
Must we wait for this? Must hands be stained
with men's blood ere the rich will bestir themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
to render justice to the poor? I pray the
fates that it may not be so! But everywhere, in
the great cities, and out in the fields, I hear the
murmur of deep, sullen discontent.</p>

<p>Think what such a man as Pugsley has
wrought in the name of Respectability. He has
systematically lied, cheated, and crushed the
weaker to the wall. He has piled up wealth by
defrauding the widow and the orphan of bare
human rights, turning them into worse than
slaves by his thrice-accursed lust for money. I
have heard of old servants being deposed in his
warehouse, and put into subordinate positions to
make way for the young; of men dismissed for
the expression of Liberal political opinions; of
hands threatened with discharge for professing
trades union principles; of fines wrung from
hungry children for trivial offences; and of
bullying and insult and injustices without
number.</p>

<p>I hear my cut-and-dried economist calling me
to account with his formulas and expositions.
Ah! I have listened to them; I have read them;
but they never have, and never will, persuade me
that Pugsley, the plutocrat, does what is right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and humane and reasonable towards those who
have built up his fortune, and bought his mansions
and his yacht, and dowered his daughters.
I know about competition, and the law of demand
and supply, and I take my stand on sound social
science. But no science that I have studied convinces
me that this plutocracy and plunder and
monopoly are good for anyone but the plutocrats
and the plunderers. And not good for them,
either, in any moral sense. Is it moral to kill the
social affections? I say that the professional
burglar is a model of virtue by the side of Pugsley.
He does not pose as a Christian philanthropist
and a friend of the people when he goes
about his nefarious business. Pugsley, the great
successful gambler, fines poor country louts for
playing pitch and toss with halfpence. The next
day he perpetrates a filthy fraud on 'Change.
Shelley was right, the true ruffian of a community
is not the cutpurse who knocks you down
in the Gray's Inn Road, and gags you, while his
accomplice grabs your watch and valuables, but
the "Respectable man&mdash;the smooth, smiling villain
whom all the City honours, whose very trade
is lies and murder; who buys his daily bread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
with the blood and tears of men." I want to
know why the big thief, Pugsley, is made a peer,
and the man who steals a handful of turnips is
sent to the County gaol?</p>

<p>The other day, a labourer, out of work, wired
a rabbit on Pugsley's estate, and went to prison
for a week for the misdemeanour. But Pugsley
annexed the very land that the rabbit was on, a
good wide strip of it, too, which belonged to the
people. I used to walk on that same ground,
looking for the first primroses. Now I must ask
Pugsley's permission before I dare set a foot
there, on this property which I own in common
with my neighbours! And you tell me that this
sort of "law and order" is good for my morals.</p>

<p>I am glad that my ethical-cum-philosophical
friend is not at my elbow just now, to suggest
that I ought to be kind to Pugsley. Why, in the
name of reason, am I to flatter and applaud this
commercial gamester? I look upon him as a
victim of morbid acquisitiveness induced by Respectability.
Pugsley thinks he must keep up
his reputation among the Respectables of his set,
and to do this he is urged to plunder the poor.
He is a dangerous maniac; he ought to be detained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and set to hard labour to cure him of his
derangement.</p>

<p>The stupidest farce played by the Pugsleys is
when one of the girls goes district visiting, and
tells the wives of the peasants earning twelve
shillings a week, that they "ought to put by for
a rainy day." I wonder that the women can
keep their patience with the ninny. If Miss
Clara Pugsley were to use her atrophied brain for
five minutes, she would know that no woman
with a husband and five children to feed and
clothe, and a rent of eighteenpence a week to pay,
can save a farthing out of such wages. It is
gross insolence of this over-fed, idle, ignorant
girl to talk in this fashion to the poor. But this
fatuous nonsense is preached all over the country
every day in the week. Ladies call it "helping
the poor to be thrifty," "elevating the workers,"
etc.</p>

<p>O, Great Pugsley, it is not envy of your possessions
that makes me dip my pen in gall,
though I know well that is what you will think
should you read these words of mine. I would
be well content with the income of your under-steward.
You have measured human nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
with your little foot-rule, and come to the opinion
that all men are naturally greedy vampires like
yourself. Believe me, Pugsley, you are sadly
wrong in this view. I know men and women
who would not stain their fingers with your
wretched blood-money for their own usage,
though they would gladly employ it for the
benefit of those from whom you filched it, drib
and drab, by underpayment of their hard, dull
toil.</p>

<p>I wish, how I wish in malignant moments,
that I had assurance of a hereafter for Pugsley
in a dark, noisome factory, where he would have
to work for ten hours a day on skilly. The
parson tells me that there is a mansion in the
skies prepared for Pugsley. And another equally
sumptuous residence for the more honest Bill
Brown, the poacher? Why not?</p>

<p>London, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield&mdash;these
are the paradises of the Pugsleys; they batten in
the rechy air of these gambling centres. How
do these dismal, over-crowded, smoke-blackened
haunts of Respectability impress "the intelligent
foreigner?" "Send a philosopher to London,
but no poet," says Heine. "Everywhere we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
stared down on by wealth and Respectability,
while, crammed away in retired lanes and damp
alleys, poverty dwells, with her rags and her
tears." Heine, like many another thinker, was
struck by the wretchedness and poverty of London,
hiding away behind the mansions of plutocrats
and Respectables. He saw "gaunt hunger
staring beseechingly at the rich merchant who
hurries along, busy and jingling gold, or at the
lazy lord who, like the surfeited god, rides by on
his high horse, casting now and then an aristocratically
indifferent glance at the mob below, as
though they were swarming ants, or, at all
events, a mass of baser beings, whose joys and
sorrows have nothing in common with his feelings;"
and the poet cried to poor Poverty, "Well
art thou in the right when thou alliest thyself to
vice and crime. Outlawed criminals often bear
more humanity in their hearts than those cold,
blameless citizens of virtue, in whose white hearts
the power of evil is quenched, but also the power
of good."</p>

<p>Mr. Grant White has written a book entitled
"England Within and Without," a very pungent
and witty delineation of the English character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
from an American point of view. He tells us
that the British Philistine is "perfect of his
kind;" that "Philistinism pervades the whole
society of Great Britain south of the Tweed."
Mr. Grant says that this Philistinism is of late
growth in England, a phenomenon of the last
hundred and fifty years. We cannot find traces of
it in the "spacious days," in the plays of Beaumont
and Fletcher, Ben Jonson, Ford, and Massinger,
nor in all the comedies of Shakspere.
Master Ford and Master Page, the townsmen of
Windsor, are neither snobs nor Philistines. But
now, in this wonderful nineteenth century, the
Philistines are as obvious as the poor; they
swarm and teem everywhere. The dense-minded
middle-class man, rich, purse-proud, vulgar, incapable
of apprehending anything beyond the
range of his own personal experience, comes upon
the stage. Enter Pugsley, with a capacious
abdomen, a red beef face, set off with cropped side
whiskers, a shiny pow, a big voice, and an imposing
cough. "He is the butt, it is true, of the
courtier and of the travelled man; nevertheless,
he is represented as the type of a large class, and
as one who is becoming a power in the land, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
who is recognised as one of the characteristic elements
of its society. He is conscious at once of
his importance, and of his social inferiority, and
he submits, although with surliness, to the snubbing
of his superiors, which sometimes takes a
very active and aggressive shape."</p>

<p>One day they will be coming round to me for
a subscription towards erecting a statue of the
Great Pugsley. You know the kind of effigy&mdash;Pugsley
in a pot-hat, beaming benevolence, on a
granite pedestal, that all who pass by may behold
and envy the glory of this apotheosis of the Successful
Man. But why should not Pugsley have
his monument? Could one devise a better way
of advertising his Piquant Pickles? Yes, let us
have a colossal bronze figure of Peter Pugsley,
M.P., in the market place of Diddleham, with
raised pickle-bottles in metal festooned around
the pedestal, and the words, "Ask for Pugsley's"
graven in the polished stone. There is not much
artistic beauty in Diddleham in the way of statuary.
The statue will supply a long-felt want.
Besides, there is a purely utilitarian aspect to the
question (they are very utilitarian at Diddleham).
At six meetings of the Town Council, the question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of where to put the public fire-escape has been
discussed with great heat. Let me suggest that it
should be stood against the memorial to Pugsley.</p>

<p>If I had a son who began to develop the faculty
of "getting on" upon the Pugsley lines, I would
do all I could to encourage the youngster. He
would earn success so easily that he would not
care a rap for it. I would go, unbeknown to
him, and scatter pins on the ground in front of
the office where he intended to apply for a clerkship,
so that he might stoop to pick them up,
thereby, like the youth in the story, convincing
the employer of his thrifty and methodical qualities.
His library should be stocked with the
lives of self-made men, the biographies of smart
bagmen, and works on how to grow money. Portraits
of successful merchants should deck the
walls of his bedroom, and he should be taught to
revere them as patron saints. I warrant such
methods of fostering the love of commercial success
would have the desired effect. The boy
would run away to "a hollow tree, a crust of
bread, and liberty."</p>

<p class="ac larger">VILLADOM.</p>

<div class="bq">"There is less inconvenience in being mad with the mad than by being
wise by oneself."</div>

<div class="bq">"It is among the respectable classes of this vast and happy empire that

<div class="bq ar">

<p>"I sojourned perforce for a long while in Villadom,"
says an enemy of Respectability; "and I
came away with some of its froust about my person."
You can't bide there without getting
harm; but the worst of it is, we have no option,
many of us; we have to live in Villadom at some
time or another in our lives. Thackeray, Guy de
Maupassant, George Gissing, and George Moore
have given us some clever studies of the kind of
folk who live in those genteel residences in the
suburbs. Mr. Moore's picture of Ashbourne
Crescent, in the last chapter of "A Drama in
Muslin," is about the finest of the sort I have met
with in fiction. It is so good a description of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
region that I am tempted beyond resistance to
steal parts of it.</p>

<p class="bq">"In Ashbourne Crescent there is neither dissent nor
Radicalism, but general aversion to all considerations
which might disturb belief in all the routine of existence,
in all its temporal and spiritual aspects, as it had come
amongst them. The fathers and the brothers go to the
City every day at nine, the young ladies play tennis,
read novels, and beg to be taken to dances at the Kensington
Town Hall. On Sunday the air is alive with the
clanging of bells, and, in orderly procession, every family
proceeds to church, the fathers in all the gravity of
umbrellas and prayer-books, the matrons in silk mantles
and clumsy, ready-made elastic sides; the girls in all the
gaiety of their summer dresses, with lively bustles
bobbing; the young men in frock-coats which show off
their broad shoulders, as from time to time they pull
their tawny moustaches. Each house keeps a cook and
housemaid, and on Sunday afternoons, when the skies
are flushed with sunset, and the outlines of this human
warren grow harshly distinct&mdash;black lines upon pale red&mdash;these
are seen walking arm-in-arm away towards a
distant park with their young men.... And that Ashbourne
Crescent, with its bright brass knockers, its
white-capped maidservants, and spotless oilcloths, will
in the dim future pass away before some great tide of
revolution that is now gathering strength far away, deep
down and out of sight in the heart of a nation, is probable
enough; but it is certainly now, in all its cheapness
and vulgarity, more than anything else representative,
though the length and breadth of the land be searched,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
of the genius of Empire that has been glorious through
the long tale that nine hundred years have to tell."</p>

<p>I have conceived of a suburban colony of
houses where a man might live and be natural
and healthy-minded among his neighbours;
where he might, if he chose, walk about in cool,
backwoods dress, a shirt, breeks, and wide-brimmed
hat&mdash;or no hat&mdash;in hot weather, without
inciting derision, or becoming a pariah. But
Villadom cares nothing for naturalness, nor
liberty of opinion and conduct; and, unconscious
of the madness of its severe conventionality, it
deems those insane who cultivate ideas and try
to live up to them. What! is there one man in
ten in this great sheep-pen who would like to be
seen blacking his own boots or sweeping the snow
from the front of his house? No, they prefer to
ill-pay some man's daughter to do all their irksome
and dirty work. What does Villadom read,
talk of, and think upon? The fathers read the
newspapers, the mothers and daughters peruse
"John Halifax," and such like literature of the
Pap-boat and Pumplighter sort; and the talk is
of money, the neighbours, and the back-parlour
window curtains and carpets&mdash;all good themes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
enough in their season, but not the only things
in life of vast importance. The denizens of Villadom
tell you that they have their livings to earn,
dinners to cook, and houses to control; therefore
there is no time for cultivating their intellects,
and developing their sense of the beautiful in
nature and art. No time! It is the old plea of
the men and women who squander hours in
tittle-tattle and loafing. Gerald Massey, a bargeman's
son, and a fag in a factory; Elihu Burritt,
a blacksmith; Thomas Edward, a shoemaker;
Walt Whitman, a compositor; Bradlaugh, a
soldier, and afterwards a clerk; James Hosken, a
postman, not to mention a hundred other hard-working
men, found time to read, and think, and
improve themselves. It is the <i>will</i>, and not the
leisure, that is lacking in Villadom, the will to be
something better than mere Respectables in the
eyes of society.</p>

<p>The foppery and frippery of Villadom are
miserable outlets for human energy. If this is
the end of civilised beings, give me rather the
wildest life of primitive barbarians, for they, at
least, wish to learn higher arts of living. No
past civilisation presents this picture of Philistine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
apathy to the nobler interests of life. Karl
Pearson says truly that the two most pitiful illustrations
of our pseudo-civilisation may be seen in
the main streets of the West End of London. In
the afternoon you see crowds of idle, shallow
women standing, rapt in the admiration of bits
of ribbon in the windows of the drapery stores.
A few hours later, when the shops are closed,
another army of women parade the pavements,
ogling and smirking in their nightly quest for
the bread of prostitution. The "ladies" of the
afternoon promenade are mostly the wives and
daughters of Villadom. They do not know how
largely responsible they are for that nocturnal
orgy of the streets when they are snug in their
luxurious drawing-rooms. It is the fetish-worship
of Respectability that makes thousands
of women redundant, drives some to the streets,
and condemns others to withered celibacy. Men
realise that the Respectable daughters of Villadom
are luxuries that they cannot afford to maintain,
in early life, at least; and the <i>demi-monde</i>
know this, too. As Mr. W. R. Greg wrote: "While
the <i>monde</i> has been deteriorating, the <i>demi-monde</i>
has been improving; as the one has grown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
stupider and costlier, the other has grown, more
attractive, more decorous, and more easy. The
ladies <i>there</i> are now often as clever and amusing,
usually more beautiful, and not infrequently (in
external demeanour, at least,) as modest, as their
rivals in more recognised society."</p>

<p>This writer, rightly or wrongly, affirms that
the way to set things straight in this anomaly of
polyandry for thousands of women, and celibacy
for thousands of their sisters is by the respectable
ladies emulating the manners, and attaining the
charms of the hetæræ, in "cheerfulness and kindliness
of demeanour," "economy of style," and
"ease and simplicity."</p>

<p>I know the advanced women&mdash;some of them, at
any rate&mdash;will tell me that men are not worth
winning at this expense, and that they prefer to
go their own ways alone. So be it. There is no
coercion to matrimony for such as elect to remain
in single independence. On the other hand, we
have not yet killed the sexual attraction and the
maternal instinct in all our emancipated women.
And, as for the girls of Villadom, <i>they</i>, at all
events, look upon marriage as their destiny.
Then, I say, let them get rid of this spurious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
virtue of Respectability, which costs so much to
maintain, and is worth nothing after all their
pains. Villadom exists principally for women.
Bachelor men do not, as a rule, need domestic
whim-whams and nick-nacks to make them
happy in their "diggings." Villadom has been
built and embellished for the fair sex; they reign
almost supreme there, and it is their part to refine
the atmosphere of their domain.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="ac larger">THE TYRANNY OF RESPECTABILITY.</p>

<div class="bq">"Men, and still more women, who lift themselves above the ordinary
standard by their philosophical tastes and speculations, may indeed be
accounted fortunate if they escape calumny or obloquy from general
society."</div>

<div class="bq ar">
<span class="sc">W. Carew Hazlitt.</span></div>

<p>"Mankind is an ass, who kicks those who endeavour
to take off his panniers," says a Spanish
proverb. When we are very young and enthusiastic
about the great part we mean to play in the
reformation of society, we work ourselves into
fearful furies of indignation with those who have
persecuted innovators in all ages. Later in life
we learn that the persecutor is more of an ass
than a villain; and the more we study humanity,
not forgetting our own human nature, the more
are we persuaded that this is the right scientific
view to take. While we had the taint of Respectability
in us (and very few men and women
are born without it), we were disposed sometimes
to do some of this asinine kicking upon those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
whom we considered dangers to society. We did
not pause to think whether they wished to help
us by removing the packs from our galled backs;
but, as soon as a Samaritan approached us with
kindly intent, we let fly our heels and attacked
him. The fact is, as Thoreau says, there are
really very few men, even of the Non-Respectables,
without some trace of Respectable prejudice.
Let us, therefore, be as tolerant as possible
towards the misguided Respectables who brutally
maltreat their would-be benefactors. Perhaps
you have never thrown flints at an itinerant
evangelist, nor hustled a Socialist in the parks;
nevertheless, you have persecuted in some shape
or form at one time of your life. Too lazy by
nature to inquire into a novel social doctrine, or
to dispassionately examine a new theory of
morals, you have misunderstood and denounced
the promulgators and theorists. This is very
often the outcome of your Respectability, and a
purely emotional manifestation of prejudice
against something that you have not tried to
understand. Thus persecution begins. If you
have a large element of the savage in you, your
opposition will take the form of actual physical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
violence and scurrilous abuse; if you are
moderately humane and intelligent, you will
merely scorn and deride the heretic. Your blood
seethes when you read of the persecution of martyrs.
Take heed of yourself that you do not
evince the malevolent spirit that impels men to
denounce others unheard, at the first suggestion
of heterodox opinion.</p>

<p>Priestley, a Unitarian minister, of Birmingham,
experimented in chemistry, and discovered
oxygen, alone and entirely unassisted, in a
laboratory fitted up at his own expense. The
world owes much to this industrious man of
science. But the human nature that killed
Christ and Bruno, hated Priestley because he
tried to convey new truths. A mob of fanatical
Respectables burned down his house, and destroyed
all his books, notes, and apparatus, and
drove him from his native land.</p>

<p>Home, the author of the tragedy of "Douglas,"
was persecuted and turned out of the ministry
by Scotch Respectables for writing a play to
amuse and instruct his fellow men; and Dr.
Alexander Carlyle was threatened with a prosecution
for standing by Home, his friend. Religious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Respectability persecuted the devout
Hannah More for instructing the children of the
poor. Moneyed Respectability hanged John
Brown, mobbed Theodore Parker, and threatened
to shoot Ernestine Rose for endeavouring to free
negro slaves. Shelley, one of the humanest souls
who ever lived, was driven from Eton by respectable
young cads, expelled from Oxford by Respectability,
and banished to another country.
Byron, who taught men, by brave precept and
example to love liberty, was reviled, slandered,
and forced to live abroad. Walt Whitman, for
showing men the beauty and purity of the reproductive
function, degraded and assailed by Respectability,
was "greeted with howls of execration."
Respectability has cursed Ibsen, Zola,
and Björnson, three mighty forces for righteousness
in Europe. Charles Bradlaugh, who devoted
his life to the service of man, was bitterly
assailed and vilely aspersed by his contemporary
Respectables. Respectable human nature kicks
everyone who sets himself to benefit humanity.
The history of this moral pest and mental blight
abounds with instances of its venomous effect
upon men's hearts and minds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can bear it no longer," cries Thackeray,
"this diabolical invention of gentility which
kills natural kindliness and honest friendship.
Proper pride, indeed! Rank and precedence,
forsooth! The table of ranks and degrees is a
lie, and should be flung into the fire. Organise
rank and precedence! That was well for the
masters of ceremonies of former ages. Come forward,
some great marshal, and organise equality
in society, and your rod shall swallow up all the
juggling old court 'goldsticks.'" Carlyle calls
England "the wealthiest and worst instructed of
European nations." Respectability piles up
money, accumulates vast stores of material products,
and starves men's minds in the process. It
tyrannises in every province of ethics, science,
art, literature, and politics, laying continually on
our shoulders burdens grievous to bear. You
can scarcely move without coming into collision
with Respectability; you are expected to eat,
drink, dress, think, marry, and be buried in accordance
with its canon. The Respectables of
the Exchange will snub and insult an independent-minded
man who ventures within the
shoddy circle without a chimney-pot hat. I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
heard this stupid tyranny of majorities defended
as a safeguard of decency and order. What!
These attempts to stamp out individuality of character
promote social progress? This is an odd
way of reasoning. But the Respectable doesn't
reason; he follows the crowd mechanically.</p>

<p>You have only to give the Respectables plenty
of rope, and they will strangle every effort of advance.
They form societies for suppressing this
thing and harrying that, with their wary scouts
prowling in every direction; they try to "rob the
poor man of his beer," while they gorge themselves
with fat meats; they fought tooth and nail
against the Sunday opening of museums and
picture-galleries; they prosecuted Mr. Vizetelly
for selling translations of Zola's novels; they
oppose amelioration of our absurd, cruel, and ineffective
prison system; they ban the teaching of
physiological morality in sex matters; and they
put hobbles and blinkers on women.</p>

<p>I have no especial veneration for Lord Beaconsfield
as a politician, but I admire him for his unconventionality.
How many young men possess
the pluck to appear at a dinner party in green
velvet trousers, a canary-coloured waistcoat, low
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
shoes with silver buckles, lace at their wrists, and
their hair in ringlets? On another occasion, Disraeli
turned up at a diocesan gathering at Oxford
clad in a black velveteen shooting jacket, with a
wideawake hat. A Respectable booby, writing
the other day to a Liberal newspaper, referred to
these eccentricities as though they were vices in a
man, instead of recognising that such flaunting
of a dull, drab Respectability, betokened courage
and individuality. Immediately you dress in accordance
with your own taste, instead of in the
mufti of convention, you are dubbed a mountebank
and a posturer. Of course, after these aberrations
of deportment and form, there is not a
good word to be said for Dizzy, only vehement
abuse and denunciation. Yet the same Radical
Respectable knew perfectly well, when he sat
down to write that diatribe, that many of his
class affect peculiarities of dress.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="ac larger">RESPECTABLE CIVILISATION AND AFTER.</p>

<div class="bq">
"I announce a life that shall be copious, vehement, spiritual, bold."</div>

<div class="bq ar"><span class="sc">Walt Whitman.</span></div>


<p>It is the boast of the ordinary patriotic Briton
that he lives in a highly civilised country.
During his tutelage, he learns that climate, or
insularity of position on the face of the globe, or
the system of monarchy, or the Bible, has, or
have, combined or separately, made England the
foremost nation on earth. In later life he is
sometimes prone to exclaim against our "advanced
civilisation," and even to go to the
extreme of asserting that we could well dispense
with much of it. The latter-day Anglo-Saxon,
who thinks without thought, has for himself a
very clear and satisfying idea of civilisation.
Emerson, on the other hand, remarks that "nobody
has attempted a definition of civilisation,"
and that "we usually suggest it by negations;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and he adduces instances of people lacking an
alphabet, iron, and abstract thought. Thus,
when we ask for an explanation of the term
Civilisation, we usually hear an enumeration of
the constituents of a state of primal savagery,
and are then possibly referred to the material
products, money, and Gatling guns of a nation
for signs of its civilisation.</p>

<p>It is then much simpler for the majority to
formulate intrinsic barbarism than to define refinement,
and to delineate a reliable ideal of
Civilisation. They are conscious that much,
if not most of that which they would designate
civilised could, upon close examination, be
proved to be barbaric. Their easy exposition will
not withstand keen scientific scrutiny; and a
definition which will not stand this test is merely
a stumbling-block in the way of inquiry. A
member of a reputedly cultured community or
class naturally resents attack upon those views
and customs which in his estimate denote
civilisation, and are of its very essence. If he is
a pious Englishman, he will probably confess
that in the matter of faith the people of Eastern
countries are barbaric, while he fails to discern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the trail of barbarity in his own creed and ritual.
In like manner, a Philistine aristocrat will
scarcely accede that there is barely one degree of
coarseness betwixt his pleasures and those of the
illiterate proletarian, who, in his turn, persuades
himself that he is more intelligent and decent
than his compeers of another land.</p>

<p>Yet the truth is that a very small number of
the inhabitants of these isles can be justly
labelled civilised. We must search, as it were, in
the mode of Diogenes for "the highly organised
man, brought to supreme delicacy of sentiment,
as in practical power, religion, liberty, sense of
honour and taste," who stands for Emerson's type
of civilised humanity. That such examples are
not unknown at this stage is as certain as the
fact that many more are in the process of evolution.
And although savagery in idea and practice
confronts us this way and that in each scale
of society, we shall do ill if we approach the
study of modern barbarism in a vein of mocking
pessimism. It is also necessary that a lively
faith in the evolutionary principle applied to
human nature should be tempered by a look
behind while our hopes are young.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly and painfully are we "working out the
beast," slowly and painfully must we climb the
stages till we cease to obey the blind dictates of
instinctive impulse and to base our codes on the
reigning opinions of the irrational mass. It is
hardly needful to reiterate even one of the preliminary
conclusions of all philosophers and
humanists to prove that most men have no
reasoned views upon the conduct of life. Seneca
says that "the common sort find it easier to
believe than to judge, and content themselves
with what is usual, never examining whether it
be good or no. By the common sort is intended
the man of title as well as the clouted shoe." The
veracity of Swift's aphorism that most men have
as much turn for flying as for thinking, and of
Carlyle's laconic "mostly fools," is unquestioned.</p>

<p>It is therefore no unsupported postulate that
the larger part of civilised people always tend to
lead barbaric lives, and that what each class is
apt to accept as an approximation to a complete
civilisation is a very inchoate form of that truer
culture urged upon society by individualist reformers
in each successive age. A very slight
examination of the thought and pursuits of what
is called the highest class in our existing social
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
scale will serve to demonstrate the prevalence of
barbarism. For there, as in the lower circles, we
find the lines of apathy, vulgarity, and animalism
graven on patrician faces, and proclaimed in
the talk of the dinner-table, the smoking-room,
and the covert-side. Obviously, all our peers are
not ultra-barbarians; neither are all our bargees
and coalheavers savages. Yet the dominant tone
is just as often low and inane in the mansion as
in the tenement, and with much less to offer in its
extenuation. Millions toil and ache, and are
vulgarised in order that a coterie of hereditary
lords and titled parvenus shall enjoy the leisure
which they mainly devote to frivolity and the
killing of the æons of time. Upon these, the
intimates of monarchs, the protectors of the
sacred pheasant, the distributors of largess, a barbaric
populace alternately lavishes its affection
and its abuse. So long as the baron flings his
groats to the churls, all is peace in vassaldom;
but when rents are racked, game laws enforced to
their utmost limits, and the dice rattled in the
hall, the voice of the people is upraised in tumult,
and the virtuous artizan, clinking his silver winnings
on the way from the racecourse, thanks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
heaven he is not as these nobles are, gamblers,
adulterers, and oppressors of the widow and the
orphan.</p>

<p>Set a barbarian to lash a barbarian if you wish
to see injustice done. The fact is that, being
barbarous, we first allow an accident of birth to
raise a man to a position of power, and then run
atilt at our shoddy dignities because the power
tends to impede general well-being. Worth of
mind is the one qualification for esteem, a trite
enough dictum in the mouths of those who persistently
ignore its truth. But the time must
come when the aristocracy of character will be
the only recognised aristocracy in civilised
nations.</p>

<p>I think that if one should suggest that it is
right to hate the members of our "bloated aristocracy,"
he is no less absurd than those who
fawn around the lackeys of a court. Our noble
lords are not of one type, as our common people
are not of one cast, though in many rude
examples of nobility we can trace the basic elements
of ruffianism, and see the bestial fruits
thereof. What most concerns us is the question
whether a society that grants titles to its successful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
money-grabbers is clean-purged of its antique
barbarism. An academical diploma conferred
upon a teacher of the arts or sciences is possibly
one means by which the respectful heed of the
uncultured is secured for new doctrine. For
the one who appends certain characters to his
signature will be held in esteem by the many as a
man worth hearing. Even in the matter of
degrees given to scholars of distinction, we too
often discover that such award fosters moral and
mental deterioration, and that it narrows and
mars the career of thinkers who are elevated to a
throne of authority. Our laureates must need
be eminently wary in their main theories, though
they may pipe an undernote of revolt in the sequestered
grove, to ease their souls of the sting of
the stultifying penalty of vulgar rank. Yes,
titles of all kinds seem to have a tendency to
degrade; and the sun of courtly favour often
withers the real and aids the growth of the spurious
nobility. "Brave old Samuel," ever a Respectable
in leading sentiments, was more so
when he took a dole from the palace. There is
little hope for the amendment of the semi-barbaric
prophet when he is taken from the wilderness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
and thrust into a position only tenurable by
wily compromise with the Respectabilities.</p>

<p>Very engrossing is the study of Respectability
in high places. "These be the men we are told
to look up to," said a tattered plebeian, whose
eyes had been blasted by the hunting magistrate
who was riding on other men's land. But that
we do "look up to" our rich, idle folk with an
avid awe is undoubted. Few persons in a town
are especially interested in hearing that Mr.
Herbert Spencer is there on a visit; but we are
most of us anxious to shake hands with a prize-fighter,
or the "Jubilee Plunger," or to take tea
with a millionaire's wife. We look up to or hunt
after such because they have vulgar notoriety
or money, and we are not concerned to know
how they came by their popularity and their cash,
and whether they deserve either, and make a good
use of their power. Were it not for the few
civilised beings who dare to be considered odd,
this odious admiration of trivial character and
empty claims would mean a ripening to the decay
of society. Involuntarily, the civilised make the
ways of barbarity easy to thousands, for they
absolve the lethargic from the exertion of severe
thinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>The paradise towards which the <i>bourgeoisie</i>
strive is not the leisure to refine the mind, but the
opportunity to vie with the more commonplace
section of the upper class in dissipation. The
labourer who resents the lordling's contumely,
and indicts him for living a lazy life, may only
work when he is starving, and perhaps not then.
His ideal may rise no higher than perpetual beer
and ninepins, while the squire craves no higher
satisfaction in life than hunting six days a week,
and champagne, billiards, and the sporting
papers on Sunday. The evil is in the setting up
of a barbaric aim of life in all classes. Our
greatest ideals are the commercial and the voluptuous.
The eternal pursuit of the frivolous,
which makes up the chief part of what is
foolishly termed "high life," and the sordid
middle-class struggle to amass money, are accepted
by the shallow as tokens of our progress
in civilisation. We are rich and luxurious; we
are therefore far above the savage. Yet how
far? Our leisured and affluent have for the
greater number returned to the employment of a
pre-pastoral epoch. Look at the lives of
thousands of English gentlemen. Truer barbarians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
never existed of old than many of those
whose whole thought, energy, and wealth are
given up to sport. Many of them are restless
nomads, ever hurrying from one quarter of the
globe to another in search of fresh game to kill.
I do not underrate the need for the development
of the physical man, nor ignore the value of
sports rightly comprehended as a means to the
end of training and recreating the body. But
what shall be said of that multitude of our
countrymen who live to amuse themselves in
such primitive fashion? It is these who waste
their powers, and barbarise the vulgar by the
force of ill example.</p>

<p>Let us not wonder that, in bygone days, a
gaping peasantry, with quaint uncouth notions of
what constituted an efficient mouthpiece of their
wants, yelled at the hustings for the return of
those who rode straight, and could pummel the
best man of the mob in a brace of rounds. Of
such order are still the credentials in some of the
Pagan constituencies, where the beer-steeped
intelligence pleads the election of "an old-fashioned
sort and a thorough sportsman."</p>

<p>We are still rearing these rude types in our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
public schools and universities, and for these we
laudably reserve the chief places on the senate,
on justiciary benches, and in local boards. Despite
their educational chances and social opportunities,
these are surely among the retrograde,
with their <i>argot</i> culled from the racing journals,
their strange drawling pronunciation of the
English tongue, their points of breeding, their
caddish <i>hauteur</i>, their rampant John Bullisms,
and their innate aversion to thought and earnestness.
"The fop of Charles's time," says Leslie,
in Mr. Mallock's "New Republic," "aimed at
seeming a wit and a scholar. The fop of ours
aims at being a fool and a dunce."</p>

<p>Quitting this strange horde, let us descend to
the mart for an examination of the Commercial
Ideal. No one denies that for a nation of shopkeepers
we have done great things in the world's
history. In a very large measure we are civilised
by the shop, and it is only when the shop absorbs
the best of us, mental and physical, that commercial
activity tends to retard progress. Provide
that a man's moral sense and intellect are not
warped or unexercised in the making of money,
and there is nothing degrading, but the opposite,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
in his desire to succeed commercially. But in
the fierceness of competition in an over-populated
country, cruel barbarity and detestable meanness
and cunning arise. And not only these, but the
curse of intellectual and æsthetic atrophy lights
upon the host. Out of this undue stress is developed
a tendency to sordid living, a preference
for the lower gratifications of life. Yet need
money-getting always degrade the people? Will
the prosperous business career of the future be
alone compatible with a low standard of thought,
and a corrupt canon of commercial morals?</p>

<p>"Life without industry is guilt; industry
without art is brutality." Now, in the push and
drive of industry at the close of this century it is
as hard for myriads to keep the soul alive, as it is
for many thousands to find food for the body.
The trader who makes Mammon his idol, who
thinks money, and spends his wealth irrationally,
brutalises life. But for the others, let us rather
pity and try to amend the condition of those who
cannot, in plain terms, "leave the shop." There
are strong-minded and somewhat exceptional
tradesmen who can shake off the dust of the warehouse,
and spend the hours of freedom in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
cultivation of the intellect. There are men of
business who do excellent work in art and science,
while their jaded associates are satisfying their
purely animal wants. The question is&mdash;Can a
man live the higher life, and <i>succeed</i> in the
worldly meaning of prosperity? Men do not
grow money by storing the brain with knowledge,
and the merchant who ponders upon a phase of
evolution, or murmurs a rhythm of Tennyson
while he is at the ledger, will most probably be
an indifferent money-maker. Lamb's <i>Good
Clerk</i>, you will remember, "gets on" because his
first aim is to be a good piece of mechanism. It
is a grievous reflection that zeal for the desk
should eat up the brain and better part of a good
man, and leave him a machine. The expert clerk
is as valuable as the clever author or the great
painter; but the trouble is that while the trader
is making himself efficient as a trader, he is frequently
neglecting his mind, narrowing his
social judgments, and tending backwards.</p>

<p>Is there no escape from a seemingly invincible
fate that restricts the thought and energy of the
million to the bare affairs of the shop? It does
almost seem at first that there is none. What we
have to determine is whether we shall aid the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
production of mediocre shopkeepers, who will
desire to live cultured lives, while they devote a
due share of thought to the shop, or whether we
shall continue to rear a class who place business
first and culture last, or practically without their
scheme of life. For every sociologist this is a
great problem. Speaking out of my own prejudice,
I would rather live in a country of moderately
prosperous men, who read, and speculated,
and had aspirations for something higher than
lucre, than in the land where the mass were rich
and unintellectual.</p>

<p>There is an economic aspect of the alternatives.
Art thrives where there is wealth; but money
does not of necessity make good art. At present
two formidable hindrances stand in the way of
developing culture&mdash;over-population, and a passion
for ostentation. Regulate the reproductive
faculty, and save the potential slave of industrialism
from a struggle that waxes keener yearly.
This must be done in the individual and national
interest, to the gradual diminishment of abject
poverty and the lessening of the awful strain in
the congested centres. Allied with this teaching,
there should be a wide inculcation of the value of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
a refined simplicity of material life, a substitution
of high-thinking for mere barbarous display
in living. These were the leading precepts of
John Stuart Mill to an unheedful generation;
but I, for one, take courage in the view that this
will become the creed of many as we advance in
the art of living. In <i>Liberty</i>, Mill writes:</p>

<p class="bq">"The superior worth of simplicity of life, the enervating
and demoralising effects of the trammels and
hypocrisies of artificial society, are ideas which have
never been entirely absent from cultivated minds since
Rousseau wrote; and they will in time produce their due
effect, though at present needing to be asserted by deeds,
for words, on this subject, have nearly exhausted their
power."</p>

<p>The way of the civiliser is hard. If the men
and women of ideals and broad sympathies go, as
Mills enjoins, into Barbaria and Philistia as
apostles, they must be prepared to receive the
hurts of primitive weapons. Missionaries are
not welcomed with barbaric shouts of glee when
they land to subvert ancient faiths. Neither are
apostles of righteousness and sweetness and light
beloved of our children of darkness in Belgravia
and Bloomsbury. But as Mr. Hamerton asks
in his "Intellectual Life": "Are the Philistines
to have all the talk to themselves for ever; are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
they to rehearse their stupid old platitudes without
the least fear of contradiction? How long,
O Lord, how long?" Yet, let your apostle be
the quintessence of tact and humility, he will not
escape slander, odium, and contempt when he
essays to contradict the ancient platitudes.
Broach boldly any subject, from religion to corset-wearing,
in the drawing-room at Bloomsbury, or
in the back parlour at Lambeth, and you will
have to contend against stubborn apathy. To
cultivate eccentricity of opinion and conduct for
the purpose of evoking the curiosity of the
languid Respectables, is a form of insanity which
no one will suppose I am advocating as an effort
towards civilisation. But social danger is always
to be apprehended from conventionality that is
stagnantly content with the existing order, and
has not the desire nor energy to advance. It is,
then, the onerous duty of a thoughtful member of
the respectable classes to awaken his relatives
or associates from a blank contentment with mere
animal well-being and trivial aims. He must
not shrink from the burden because it is the
habit of unthinking persons to believe that the
conclusions of sounder brains have been gained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
by the same meagre thinking as their own
flimsy theories, or that his wrought-out views are
only crotchets advanced to flatter his egoism.
For by those who shirk deep thinking, intellectual
seriousness in others is merely regarded as a
more or less peculiar temperamental trait. They
do not know that the eternal voluntary martyrdom
of thinkers is their salvation. They are
unaware that the good and the earnest toil daily
in order that the evil and the frivolous may be
preserved to reap the reward of toilsome thought,
in which the apathetic have had no share, and for
which they have little praise. Reflect upon what
Darwin has done for morality, science, and art,
and then mark the mean ingratitude and ignorant
misrepresentation of some of those who are
now being made whole by his sane science. Will
the Respectables always crucify their social
redeemers?</p>

<p>Not wholly encouraging is the investigation of
barbarism in our industrial and proletarian
classes. Yet perhaps, if there is one party above
another that appears to be progressing rapidly
towards a higher civilisation, it is the operative.
When one thinks of what the working class has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
done, with its lack of advantage in the past, and
its scant opportunity in the present, the progress
is one of the most wonderful and hopeful omens
of modern times. It is inevitable that the acquisition
of a little knowledge should bear some ill
fruit among the sound; but the humanising
influences of education far exceed in their proved
result the expectation of the early pioneers of a
noble movement. Much has been done, and much
remains to be accomplished, in the work of constructing
the foundations and superstructure of
an ultimate democratic civilisation. Whitman
and Ibsen, latter-day prophets of sound social
foresight, predicted at the outset of their careers
that in the fibre and stuff of a cultured democracy
lies our hope.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the moral tone of the industrial
class is growing higher yearly. The rough hand
of the artisan has fashioned much of our civilisation,
and his hard, calculating intelligence will
have a larger share in the government of the near
future. I confess that it thrills me to hear that a
set of miners in the North have begged the custodian
of a public library to provide them with
Mr. Meredith's fine but "difficult" novels.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Again, we should rejoice to learn that a factory
worker, who has taught himself to read at the age
of forty, is studying Mr. Spencer's "First
Principles."</p>

<p>As I have before tried to show, the neglect of
civilising thought and study is not voluntary in
the case of many busy men and women. It is
largely an outcome of complex commercial
rivalry and overpressure that thousands should
not share in the higher refinements of civilisation,
and that science should be outside their rule of
life instead of at the bottom of it. Thoreau
speaks of the best part of the husbandman being
ploughed into the soil for compost; and the
figure represents the case for legions of toilers.
Mr. Ruskin is among the oracles when he announces
that "the final outcome of all wealth is
the producing as many as possible full-breathed,
bright-eyed, and happy-hearted human creatures."
Perhaps so; but for the nonce, we
mostly plod on in that "dim-eyed and narrow-chested
state of being," which we are wont to
describe as "getting on in the world."</p>

<p>It is a great thing, this educational advance of
the tool-skilled. Yet there is much to be done.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
It is needless to rehearse the manifold savage
characteristics, the mob frenzies, and the low
pleasures of many of the working class&mdash;imperfections
which all of us exhibit either in like
kind or with faint difference. We forget that a
mechanic who indulges in a weekly debauch, and
sometimes beats a constable, has his counterpart
in those who call themselves superior. Ruffianism,
brutality, and gross sensuality are not restricted
to one class. English epicurism is
mostly of the lower kind in every rank. The uncivilised
of the upper class spend the larger part
of their incomes upon dishes and drinks; the
coarse of the labouring class expend nearly half
their wages on beer. Our sensuousness trends in
the direction of sensuality. We pride ourselves
that we are able to consume quantities of flesh,
and we apotheosise John Barleycorn with
Shakspere.</p>

<p>Very sombre is the spectacle of the life that
bruises the million. To one who walks the
streets observantly on public holidays, the white
faces and worn bodies of his toiling brothers tell
of dull, grinding lives. See the poor mercantile
clerks and the shopmen, the genteel drudges, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
indispensable factors of wealth which they will
never share. Well does Guy de Maupassant
picture the type:</p>

<p class="bq">"With sallow faces and twisted bodies, and one of
their shoulders a little forced up by perpetual bending
at work over a table ... they all belonged to the
army of poor threadbare devils who vegetate frugally in
a mean little plaster-house, with a flower bed for a
garden."</p>

<p>How can we inveigh against these tired workers
for the drowsy occupation of their few leisure
hours? What is chiefly at fault is the crushing
system that leaves so little time for expansion of
the mind and the sympathies, the ideal that
shapes the many to this level cast. Mr. Grant
White gives a grimly sardonic sketch of a London
shopkeeping pair in his "England Without
and Within." He tells of faces that had probably
"once expressed some of the vivacity of
youth; but this had passed away, and nothing,
no trace of thought or feeling, had come into its
place&mdash;only fat; a greasy witness of content."
But there is more pathos than humour in this
study from lower middle-class life. Were there
not originally the germs of ideas, imagination,
and emotion, in these unfortunate contented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
souls? Are such doomed to take no thought for
higher things than bread-getting and eating,
and will their minds for ever starve on the Bethel
hymn and the newspaper?</p>

<p>More pitiful and tragic is the state of the
lowest, the lapsed, the untameable of the slums.
"Our society," says M. Taine, "is a fine edifice,
but in the lowest story what a sink of impurity....
It seems to me that the evil and the good
are greater here than in France." The law cannot
cure inherent propensities to evil doing, and
pious philanthropy can merely patch a rotten
vestment; but scientific criminologists will
eventually probe to the root. Too long have we
relied upon the gaoler and the priest. We are
learning now that congenital crime is a subject
for the physiologist and the mental pathologist.
So, too, with the plague of chronic destitution,
the prime infamy of pseudo-civilisation. Instinctive
barbaric pity urges liberal almsgiving;
but the beautiful emotion of sympathy needs as
much control in its gratification as the purely
animal appetites. We shall awake soon to the
truth that it is our selfish Respectability that
must be fought with the weapons of a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
economic science, based upon righteousness. We
should strive to destroy the sources of hopeless
want, as we endeavour to exterminate disease
microbes in the body.</p>

<p>Are these the visions of Utopianism? No; for
when we consider what modern science has done
in its infancy, we may surely reckon upon
greater victory in days now dawning. To support
this inspiring creed of science we do not
need to fabricate evidences out of improbability,
conjecture, and fallacy; for the proofs are plain
and convincing, and will survive the severest
criticism. Truly, if we make moan one day for
the tenacity of unreason in the human brain, we
may rejoice on the morrow in the thought that
never in history has the outlook been brighter.</p>

<p>It is too evident that thousands who can no
longer be satisfied with the guesses of primitive
barbarians concerning man's origin and destiny
still cover their inner convictions with the cloak
of Respectability, and endeavour to seem that
which they are not. Honesty will thrive with
the wane of Respectability.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="ac larger">CONCLUSION.</p>

<div class="bq">"Respect is often paid in proportion as it is claimed."</div>

<div class="bq ar">
<span class="sc">Dr. Johnson.</span></div>

<p>Respectable reader, you are perchance by this
time partly inclined to at least agree that this disease
of yours may be harmful to yourself and to
others. I have not minced my words in discussing
the unpleasant symptoms of your ailment.
You are a prey to hallucinations, and it behoved
me, as a judicious physician, to jeer at your
fancies and to deride your dreads. I have endeavoured
to convince you that Respectability is
anti-social, improgressive, and often cruel. You
cannot deny that the world's greatest moral
worthies have been the Non-Respectables, the
Unconventionalists, the enlightened Eccentrics.
They have all deviated in some particular, or in
many ways, from the ordinary standards and customs
of the majority. In many instances they
have been accounted immoral, but that has not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
deterred them, because new morality has always
been deemed immorality by the Respectables.
Wesley, for example, thought it immoral to
doubt the existence of witches. Yet, who to-day
but the most degraded peasants of the wild hills
believes in witches? Mr. Gladstone considers
divorce immoral; but those who differ from him
may be counted in millions. They are the adherents
of a new morality, more reasonable, just,
and humane than the old which has passed away.</p>

<p>Therefore, to make progress we are compelled
to defy Respectability, and to outrage propriety.
But that does not mean that we are to become
ruthless Vandals, taking delight in destroying
everything that is old. Far from it. We must
pull down that idol Respectability from its
throne, and set up some worthier object of veneration
in its place. True worth and integrity of
character can have no alliance with intellectual
insincerity and social hypocrisy. We need more
brave-hearted men and women, with the courage
of their opinions, more heterodox thinkers, more
consistent heretics to stand solidly together in a
great attack on the shams and falsehoods that
constitute Respectability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>Our children must be taught to use their
brains, so that when they grow up they will not
allow their little corner of the world to rule their
lives and make them cowardly and deceitful.
The words of the Knight in "Pericles" should be
taught to boys: "<i>We are gentlemen that neither
in our hearts nor outward eyes envy the great, nor
do the low despise.</i>" Education must be freed
from the restrictions and hindrances of Respectability,
and made catholic, comprehensive, and
equal for both sexes.</p>

<p>The canker has eaten too long at the heart of
our great nation. Its ravages, if unchecked, will
ultimately destroy our prestige, and we shall fall
as Babylon, Rome, and Greece have fallen. Our
social affections are blighted and chilled by this
fell disease, our emotions are shrivelled, our
national virility enfeebled. Colonies in their
youth offer us a good illustration of the rapid
progress of a people who have abandoned the cant
of Respectability. In such communities men
and women work for the commonweal, on a fraternal
basis, with no heed to rank and precedence,
and it is in these societies that individualism,
independence, and unconventionality have full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
play and outlet. Only at a later stage does the
blight of Respectability descend upon the people
of a new country, as we see it now in America,
and, to a certain extent in Australia and Canada,
where the <i>bourgeoisie</i> have established themselves
and infected the populace with their disease.
"This diabolical invention of gentility," as
Thackeray terms it, is disintegrating society in
England, slowly and surely. It is not foreign
aggression, nor anarchy within, that we should
most fear, but the insidious virus of the disease
that is sapping our vitals.</p>

<p>It is the middle-men of the middle class who
chiefly spread the contagion and transmit it to
posterity. Antiquated political economists tell
us that the middleman is useful to everyone, and
that the man who gambles with other folk's
money is a benefactor. There was a time when
trade meant a handicraft; now it is a term for
gambling with articles made by ill-rewarded
workers. And the man who lives by this system
of dealing expects the farmer, the miner, and
craftsmen to doff their caps to him, and call him
gentleman. "Since every Jack became a gentleman,
there's many a gentle person made a Jack,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
says Shakspere. No one with a clear gaze on
the future can delude himself that the middleman
is a permanent institution, to be preserved
and commended. His respectability, without
dwelling upon his economic <i>raison d'être</i>, has
made him the contempt of the upper class and the
detestation of the working population. He has
made himself king of provincial towns, censor of
morals, and patron of the arts; and the mob has
let him gain the upper hand, looking on with
mouths agape at his cleverness. Respectability
in its worst forms will last as long as the <i>bourgeoisie</i>
possess this power over the masses.</p>

<p>I leave it to Anarchists, Socialists, Individualist,
Tories, and the rest to settle whether the
shoddy god, Respectability, is to reign despotically
over England.</p>

<i>AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY</i>.<br />
By <span class="sc">Hugh Mortimer Cecil</span>.</p>

<p class="ac"><i>An Irrational Trio: Kidd, Drummond, Balfour.</i></p>

<p>A vigorous refutation of the well-known Pseudo-Philosophical
Works, <i>Social Evolution</i> (Kidd), <i>The Ascent of Man</i>
(Drummond), and <i>The Foundations of Belief</i> (Balfour), showing
the absurdity of the methods adopted on the one hand,
and the insincerity of these Pseudo-Philosophers on the
other.</p>

<p><i>The Academy</i>, <span class="sc">April 17, 1897</span>:</p>

<p>Mr. Hugh Mortimer Cecil will have none of this
legerdemain; the flank of the rationalist position shall
not be so turned if his vigilance can frustrate the
manoeuvre; and with a pen steeped in sulphuric acid,
he has set out to confute these writers one by one.</p>

<p>... He is one who must be reckoned with as a
clear thinker, a cogent reasoner, a lucid and accomplished
writer....</p>

<p>It is impossible, in the space at our disposal, to
consider at large Mr. Cecil's criticism of "Foundations
of Belief." It is a very serious and capable attack
which will have to be reckoned with. Especially
damaging is the criticism of Mr. Balfour's theory of
authority. That argument can be employed with effect
only by one religious body, and it is not that body of
which Mr. Balfour is a member. And here we venture
to suggest to Mr. Cecil that it would be well were he to
find out, before the issue of a second edition, the
meaning of the Roman Catholic dogma of the Immaculate
Conception, to which he more than once alludes;
he appears to be under the impression that the phrase
is equivalent to parthenogenesis.</p>


<p><i>The New Saturday Review</i>, <span class="sc">April 17, 1897</span>:</p>

<p>The book is only one of many evidences of the fact
that it is quite time the theologians recognised the real
danger of their position, and sent into the lists stronger
champions than those we have been writing about. It
is little to the credit of the theological leaders that,
after first condemning Darwin and vilifying some of his
supporters, they should adopt his teaching only to misrepresent
it, and to make a sophistical use of that misrepresentation.
Of what moment are all the questions
concerning ecclesiastical tradition and ritual in comparison
to the great question of the relation between
science and religion which is agitating the minds of those
who will be the shapers and formers of the next
generation?</p>

<p>It is not the simple souls who find their modern gospel
in Kidd's "Social Evolution" or in Drummond's
"Ascent of Man," good as those simple souls are, that
will make the dominant public opinion of the next half
century. Nor are the rank-and-file of the clergy&mdash;of
all denominations&mdash;in many instances qualified to
engage effectively in this controversy. Their pulpit
science has long been a by-word. Unless some defenders
of the orthodox position abler than those that have yet
appeared can be found, the rationalists will be believed
when they boast, as our author does, that they hold a
"fortress that is quite impregnable." Pseudo-science
and pseudo-philosophy are not science or philosophy at
all.</p>

<p>Our author's book will probably win its way into only
a few of the libraries of the orthodox. Rationalists will
read it, and will find in it only a vigorous statement of
their own opinions. The proper use of the book is to
show the orthodox what they have to do, if they would
defend their position....</p>

<p>It is a challenge which would deserve attention if it
stood alone. But it does not stand alone; it is
backed up by a great body of philosophers and scientists
and social reformers, and men of the highest culture
and noblest characters, as well as by a vast amount of
smouldering suspicion and distrust and doubt among the
people.</p>


<p><i>National Observer and British Review</i>, <span class="sc">April 17, 1897</span>:</p>

<p>Portions of the author's criticisms are not only just,
but valuable; and when he is judicious enough to suppress
his own personality, he can often be read not only
with assent, but with satisfaction. The chief object of
Mr. Cecil's antipathy is any attempt at reconciling
positive science with religion, whether the religion be
Christianity, or merely a natural theism; and, as types
of the methods by which the attempt is now being made,
he takes the arguments of three modern apologists&mdash;Mr.
Kidd, Mr. Drummond, and Mr. Arthur Balfour. He
takes these in order. The first section of his work is a
criticism of "Social Evolution"; the second of "The
Ascent of Man"; the third, of "The Foundations of
Belief." In completely discrediting the two first of these
three works, Mr. Cecil's task has been easy, and he has
shown considerable skill in accomplishing it. If we take
Mr. Kidd's "Social Evolution" as it stands, it is difficult
to imagine a more signal monument of self-deception;
and when we recollect the avidity with which a
large section of the public devoured the volume, and
allowed themselves to be deceived with the author, we
feel that such a fallacious guide can hardly be too
trenchantly exposed. Mr. Cecil contrives, with the
adroitness of a sharp solicitor, to collect and place side
by side a number of Mr. Kidd's self-contradictions, and
shows that his argument, taken as a whole, falls to
pieces at one touch of serious criticism. He shows also
that Mr. Kidd's history is as childish and imperfect as
his logic.</p>

<p>... But, in spite of these omissions, he has said
quite enough to discredit effectually what would rank
as the most remarkable specimen of contemporary
pseudo-philosophy, if it were not for a specimen produced
by a Scottish writer, who has distanced altogether
the fallacies of his English rival. This last is
Mr. Drummond's "Ascent of Man;" and it is in his
criticism of this that Mr. Cecil shows himself at his
best. Had he only been less destitute of the rudiments
of good behaviour and good feeling, we should have had
little but commendation to bestow on the manner in
which he exposes Mr. Drummond's absurd justifications
of the ways of God to man, and the hopeless inaccuracies
of his theories as to altruism, and "the
struggle for the life of others." Few books in the long
run do more harm than such books as "The Ascent of
Man." Instead of really reconciling religion and science,
they injure religion by making the attempt at
reconciliation ridiculous.</p>


<p><i>The Morning Leader</i>, <span class="sc">March 25, 1897</span>:</p>

<p>Mr. Cecil is a born fighter. He attacks with courage
and cunning and resource, having at command a never-failing
artillery of invective to complete the havoc he
works by means of his sapping and mining. This latter
plan of campaign he mercilessly pursues by quotation
after quotation from previous essays and pamphlets of
his "irrationalist trio," preparing his reader for the overthrow
of the citadel by showing how hollow and unsubstantial
are the outworks. So savagely complete, indeed
is the attack that as one gazes upon the ruins of Kidd,
Drummond, and Balfour, a feeling of sympathy with the
fallen philosophers must take the place of joy in the
whizzing of the rationalist shells.</p>

<p>The method of attack adopted by this new and
puissant slogger shows, perhaps, a little too much contempt
for the enemy, a little too much confidence in
the impregnability of the attacking party's position.
But, although the book may enrage the philosophic
doubters, it is bound to make a glorious show for the
robuster members of the rationalist party. The author's
advice to the former is to "feed on the religious novel
of Mrs. Humphry Ward, the geology of Sir J. W. Dawson,
the apologetics of Mr. Gladstone, and the biographies of
Jesus that are said to be in preparation by Mr. Hall Caine,
Mr. Ian Maclaren, and Mr. Crockett&mdash;three gentlemen
whose capacity for sentimental fiction is the best guarantee
of their fitness for such a task." Language of this
kind is distinctly provocative, but it may be found bracing
enough to the energetic rejector of scientific compromise.
Whatever "Pseudo-Philosophy" may lack in urbanity
and serenity, no charge can be brought against it
on the score of dulness or stupidity. The book is at once
a brilliant and pitiless exposure of loose thinking, and
a literary entertainment of the richest kind.</p>
